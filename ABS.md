Asset-backed securities (ABS) are created by buying and bundling loans – such as residential mortgage loans, commercial loans or student loans – and creating [[Securities]] backed by those assets, which are then sold to [[investor]]s. Often, a bundle of loans is divided into separate securities with different levels of risk and returns. Payments on the loans are distributed to the holders of the lower-risk, lower-interest securities first, and then to the holders of the higher-risk securities. 

Most public offerings of ABS are conducted through expedited SEC registration procedures known as “[[shelf offering]]s.” ABS offerings also are sold as private placements which are exempt from [[SEC]] registration. Privately-issued ABS are typically sold to large institutional [[investor]]s known as qualified institutional buyers or [[QIB]]s. 

During the financial crisis, ABS holders suffered significant losses. The crisis revealed that many [[investor]]s were not fully aware of the risk in the underlying mortgages within the pools of securitized assets.

In April 2010, the Commission proposed certain revisions to the existing rules applicable to ABS transactions, including:

- Requiring the filing of tagged, computer-readable, standardized information about the specific assets, or loans, in the pool. This so-called “loan-level information” would be provided at the time the asset is securitized _and_ on an ongoing basis.  
     
- Requiring the ABS issuer to file on the SEC website a computer program that provides [[investor]]s with a tool to analyze information about specific loans within the pool of assets. This computer program would show the effect of the so-called “waterfall” so [[investor]]s can analyze how the borrowers’ loan payments are distributed to [[investor]]s in the ABS, how losses or lack of payment on those loans will be divided among the [[investor]]s, and when administrative expenses, such as loan servicing fees, are paid to service providers.  
     
- Providing [[investor]]s with more time to consider information about the pool of securitized assets before they need to make an investment decision.  
     
- Repealing an existing condition that issuers must receive an “investment grade” rating for an ABS in order to be granted “shelf” or expedited eligibility. Instead, the rules would establish new conditions for ABS shelf eligibility.  
     
- Increasing transparency in the private ABS market by revising SEC safe harbors (which provide an exemption from SEC registration) to require ABS issuers to:  
       
    - File a notice of ABS offerings conducted in reliance on the SEC safe harbor.  
         
    - Represent in their transaction agreement that they will make available to [[investor]]s the same information about the securities that would be provided if the offering were publicly registered.
