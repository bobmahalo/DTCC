Additional Public Offering or [[Follow on Offering]]. A Follow-on Registered Offering [[FRO]] is a registered offering of securities by a public company([[Issuer]]) whose [[Securities]] already trade in the [[Secondary market]] to raise additional capital.

Issuers can also raise capital through **additional public offerings (APOs)**, sometimes known as **follow-on offerings**. In the common stock chapter, [we learned issuers authorize a certain number of shares when a corporation is formed](https://app.achievable.me/study/finra-series-7/learn/c4258449-2bc0-4067-9eee-5203f8238312), but usually sell a portion of those shares. This allows the issuer to raise additional capital by selling more shares at a later date. If a company has stock outstanding and decides to sell more to the public, it’s considered an APO.

In each circumstance, _**primary market transactions create proceeds for the issuer**_. IPOs, APOs, and private placements are the most common forms of primary market sales. In the next section, we’ll dive deeper into the IPO process.

Sometimes new shares are offered to the public,
## but the proceeds do not go to the issuer.

Known as **secondary offerings**, these transactions are typically the result of large shareholders (usually company executives) selling a significant portion of shares.

[[underwriting]] is typically filed with [[FINRA]] .

Also known as [[FRO]]. The [[Capital Formation]] happens once the [[securities]] have been through the [[Underwriting]] process and the [[Syndicate]] negotiates a price. After this the [[Secondary market]] handles the rest and the [[Issuer]] has no more involvement with the stock other than [[Treasury Stock]].
