[[underwriting]] is typically filed with [[FINRA]] .

Also known as [[FRO]]. The [[Capital Formation]] happens once the [[securities]] have been through the [[Underwriting]] process and the [[Syndicate]] negotiates a price. After this the [[Secondary market]] handles the rest and the [[Issuer]] has no more involvement with the stock other than [[treasury stock]].
