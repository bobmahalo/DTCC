An alternative trading system (ATS) is an [[SEC]]-regulated trading venue in which a computerized system matches buy and sell orders of [[Securities]]. An ATS is not a national securities [[Stock Exchange]], an ATS may apply to the SEC to become a [[national securities exchange]].[1](https://www.finra.org/compliance-tools/map-tools/alternative-trading-systems-guidance#_ftn1) An ATS that registers as a [[Broker]]-dealer must also comply with the obligations associated with being a registered broker-dealer, including [[FINRA]] membership and compliance with FINRA rules.[2](https://www.finra.org/compliance-tools/map-tools/alternative-trading-systems-guidance#_ftn2)

For purposes of this Guidance, a prospective applicant for new membership should carefully review, in particular, Rules [1012](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/1012)(General Provisions), [1013](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/1013) (New Member Application and Interview), [1014](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/1014) (Department Decision), and for an existing [[Member]] that is contemplating the operation of an ATS, Rules 1012, 1014, and [1017](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/1017) (Application for Approval of Change in Ownership, Control, or Business Operations).
