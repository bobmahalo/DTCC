**Requirements for Book-Entry-Only (“BEO”) Securities**

**a. Letters of Representations (“LOR”)**

The minimum requirement for a [[Participant]] to request a Security to become eligible at [[DTC]] is the submission of an offering document and a completed eligibility request in UW SOURCE or UWC. (_See_ Section I (A), Eligibility Requirements.) In addition, [[Issuer]]s of BEO issues must submit to DTC a fully executed LOR on DTC’s preprinted form. This LOR represents the Issuer’s agreement to comply with the requirements set forth in this [[OA]], as amended from time to time. BEO [[Securities]] are DTC-eligible securities for which (i) [[Physical Securities Certificates]] are not available to investors and (ii) DTC, through its [[nominee]], [[Cede & Co]]., will hold the entire balance of the [[public offering]], either at DTC or through a [[FAST]] Agent in DTC’s Fast Automated Securities Transfer (“FAST”) program. Issuers of BEO securities, that are either FAST or where a physical master certificate is delivered to DTC, must submit to DTC a LOR among the Issuer, its Agent (as applicable) and DTC, prior to such issue being determined to be eligible. For corporate and municipal securities, there are two acceptable forms of LOR: a Blanket Issuer Letter of representations (“BLOR”) or an Issuer Letter of Representations (“ILOR”). A BLOR is Issuer specific and, except with respect to MMI securities, applicable to all DTC-eligible securities (debt and/or [[Equity]]) of the same Issuer. Once a BLOR is on file for an Issuer, a new BLOR is not required for future issuances of non-MMI unless the Issuer’s name changes (in which case an opinion of counsel may also be required). An ILOR may be used for discrete issuances, and is applicable only to that issue of securities, such as trust issuances. In all LORs, Issuers represent that they will comply with this OA, as amended from time to time. Issuers, MMI Issuing Agents and MMI Paying Agents issuing MMI Securities must submit on DTC’s form, a fully executed BLOR, effective for each MMI security issued by the Issuer through the MMI Issuing Agent and MMI Paying Agent at DTC. The BLOR would apply to all issuances of a given issuer and its identified MMI Issuing and MMI Paying Agent. However, if an issuer designates a different [[IPA]] for its issuances, or if an IPA acts on behalf of a different issuer, a new BLOR must be executed by the relevant parties. For the current form of BLOR for MMI securities please refer to https://www.dtcc.com/legal/issue-eligibility.

**b. Required Riders to LOR**

Riders are required for all older issues of [[Rule 144A]] and [[Reg S]] Securities, Securities denominated or having payments in non-US currencies, and for each Security of an Ireland or a U.K. issuer. All relevant [[CUSIP]] numbers must be listed on each applicable rider. Copies of LORs and riders may be obtained from DTCC’s website at http://www.dtcc.com/legal/issue-eligibility. For current forms of the BLOR and ILOR for non-MMI Securities, respectively, please refer to http://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/issue-eligibility/eligibility**/**BLOR-Template.pdf, and http://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/issue-eligibility/eligibility/ILOR-Template.pdf. For the current form of BLOR for MMI securities please refer to https://www.dtcc.com/legal/issue-eligibility.

Note: Sample offering document language describing book-entry-only issuance can be found in “Schedule A” to the DTC BLOR or ILOR form.

**c. Electronic Certificates for Retail CDs**

Issuers leveraging the use of electronic master certificates for Retail CDs must submit to DTC on DTC’s form, a fully executed BLOR and its associated Rider, for each base CUSIP issuing Retail CDs through the electronic process. For the current form of the E-CD BLOR please refer to https://www.dtcc.com/legal/issue-eligibility.

**d. Agreements of Underwriter, Issuer and Agent (including MMI Issuing Agent and MMI Paying Agent for MMI Securities)**

By any request for eligibility and by deposit of securities which are made eligible at DTC, the [[Underwriter]], Issuer and Agent, as applicable, each acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth below.

i. There shall be deposited with DTC one or more security certificates registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede & Co., for each stated maturity of the Securities, the total of which represents 100% of the principal amount of that issuance. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any maturity exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each principal amount of $500 million and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue. Each security certificate will bear the legend set forth in Section II(A)(3), Legends.
ii. Issuer, with respect to Securities issued by it and held at DTC, recognizes that DTC does not in any way undertake to, and shall not have any responsibility to, monitor or ascertain the compliance of any transactions in the Securities with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) (i) the [[Securities Act of 1933]] and the rules and regulations thereunder, including but not limited to Rule 144A, Reg S, and/or any exemptions from registration thereto, (ii) the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] and the rules and regulations thereunder, as amended from time to time (collectively, the “Securities Exchange Act”); (b) the [[Investment Company Act]]; (c) the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time; (d) the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time; (e) any rules of any self-regulatory organizations([[SRO]]) (as defined under the Securities Exchange Act); or (f) any other local, state, federal, or foreign laws or regulations thereunder.

iii. In the event of a redemption, acceleration, or any other similar transaction necessitating a reduction in the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding or an advance refunding of part of the securities outstanding, DTC, in its discretion (i) may request Issuer or Agent to issue and authenticate a new security certificate; or (ii) may make an appropriate notation on the affected security certificate held in custody by DTC or its agent indicating the date and amount of such reduction in principal, except in the case of final maturity, in which case the security certificate will be presented to Issuer or Agent prior to payment, if required. 

iv. DTC may direct any Issuer or Agent to use any DTC telephone number, street address, and/or e-mail address or other electronic means as the number or address to which notices or payments may be sent.

v. In the event that an Issuer determines that beneficial owners of Securities shall be able to obtain security certificates for securities of that Issuer, the Issuer or its Agent shall notify DTC accordingly. In such event, the Issuer or Agent shall issue, transfer, and exchange security certificates in appropriate amounts, as required by DTC and others.

vi. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to any securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to any Issuer or Agent (at which time DTC will confirm with such Issuer or Agent the aggregate principal amount of securities of such Issuer or its Agent which are then outstanding). Under such circumstances, the affected Issuer or Agent shall cooperate fully with DTC to take appropriate actions to make available one or more separate security certificates evidencing the affected securities to any [[Participant]] having such securities credited to its DTC account.

vii. Nothing herein shall be deemed to require any Agent to advance funds on behalf of any Issuer.

viii. Issuer: (a) understands that DTC has no obligation to, and will not, communicate to its Participants, or to any other person having any interest in the securities, any information contained in the security certificate(s) representing securities issued by that Issuer; and (b) acknowledges that neither DTC’s Participants nor any other person having any interest in such securities shall be deemed to have notice of the provisions of the security certificate(s) by virtue of submission of such security certificate(s) to DTC.

ix. The sender of each notice delivered to DTC pursuant to this OA is responsible for confirming that such notice was properly received by DTC.

x. All notices and payment advices sent to DTC shall refer to the CUSIP number of the securities subject of such notice or payment advice.

xi. With respect to securities eligible for transfer under Rule 144A or Reg S, Issuer makes the representations set forth in Section II.A.1.b. below.

xii. Issuer and Agent shall comply with the applicable requirements stated in this OA, as amended from time to time.

**e. Agreements of Issuer, MMI Issuing Agent and MMI Paying Agent for MMI Securities**

By any request for eligibility and by deposit of MMI Securities that are made eligible at DTC, the Issuer, MMI Issuing Agent and MMI Paying Agent, as applicable, each further acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth below.

i. Issuer or MMI Issuing Agent has obtained from the CUSIP Service Bureau a written list of CUSIP numbers in accordance with the requirements set forth in II.A.1.a. below.

ii. If issuance of securities through DTC is scheduled to take place one or more days after MMI Issuing Agent has given issuance instructions to DTC, MMI Issuing Agent may cancel such issuance by giving a cancellation instruction to DTC through the DTC settlement interface (“Settlement Interface”).

iii. At any time that MMI Paying Agent has securities in its DTC accounts, it may request withdrawal of such securities from DTC by giving a withdrawal instruction to DTC through the Settlement Interface. Upon DTC’s acceptance of such withdrawal instruction, MMI Paying Agent shall reduce the principal amount of the securities evidenced, as the case may be, by the master note certificate, or by one or more global certificates, accordingly.

iv. MMI Paying Agent may override DTC’s determination of interest and principal payment dates, subject to any applicable fees set forth in the DTC Guide to Fee Schedule through DTC’s corporate actions system.

**f. LOR Requirements for Certificated Securities**

Issuers of Securities which allow for physical security certificates to be available to investors (“Certificated Securities”) are typically not required to sign a LOR; however, in some cases, the applicable Issuer and/or Agent may be required to sign a LOR (and cause the securities to be held in BEO form at DTC).
An issue of securities with a unique payment structure or processing requirement may not be made eligible in a form having [[Physical Securities Certificates]] available to investors. By way of example only, securities with a provision for monthly optional redemptions by the Issuer are required to be in BEO format. BEO format must also be used for issues securities that require Agent’s books to close for one or more weeks prior to an interest payment and for which no transfers are processed by Agent.
