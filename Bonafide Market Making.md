This example is a personal anecdote. Please read with this in mind.
A great perspective to consider is [[Delta Hedging]] and how is that considered [[Market Making]].

Regulation SHO – Bona Fide Market Making Exemptions
Regulatory Obligations and Related Considerations

Regulatory Obligations

[[Rules 203(b)]] (Short sales) and [[Rule 204]] (Close-out requirement) of [[Reg SHO]] provide exceptions for bona fide [[Market Making]] activity. The [[SEC]] has provided guidance on what constitutes “bona fide market making activities” as well as examples of what does not. Member firms must also confirm and be able to demonstrate that any transaction for which they rely on a Regulation SHO bona fide market making exception qualifies for the exception, consistent with Regulation SHO and guidance.[1](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/reports/2024-finra-annual-regulatory-oversight-report/regulation-sho#_edn1) For example, reliance on and compliance with an exchange’s market making designation and quoting requirements does not _per se_ qualify a [[Market Maker]] for the bona fide market maker exception. **Additionally, a bona fide market maker must regularly and continuously place quotations in a quotation medium on both the bid and ask side of the market.** Only market makers engaged in bona-fide market making in the security at the time they effect the short sale may rely on the exception.[2](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/reports/2024-finra-annual-regulatory-oversight-report/regulation-sho#_edn2)

**Rule 204 of Regulation SHO requires that member firms close out fails-to-deliver within established timeframes by purchasing or borrowing the relevant security by market open on the relevant close out date. Pursuant to SEC guidance, a member firm may use exchange-traded funds ([[ETF]]) conversion activity to meet the purchase requirement of the rule under certain circumstances as detailed in a** [**2017 SEC No-Action Letter**](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mr-noaction/2017/murphy-mcgonigle-042617-204-sho.pdf)**. This position is limited to ETF conversion activity and does not extend to using American Depositary Receipts (ADR) conversion activity to comply with the purchase requirements of Rule 204.**
