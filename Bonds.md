### ESSENTIALS

- Bonds and bond funds can help diversify your portfolio.
- Bond prices fluctuate, although they tend to be less volatile than [[Stock]]s.
- Some bonds, particularly U.S. Treasury [[Securities]], come with relatively lower risks and can help preserve capital and potentially generate income.
- When interest rates rise, bond prices tend to fall, and vice versa.
- [[FINRA]]’s [Fixed Income Data](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/fixed-income) offers an easy way to find bond facts, including real-time data on corporate and agency bonds and important educational information.

Debt securities, also known as fixed income securities, are financial instruments that have defined terms between a [[Borrower]] (the [[Issuer]]) and a lender (the investor). Bonds, issued by a corporation, government, federal agency or other organization to raise capital, are a common type of debt security in which the borrower agrees to pay interest in exchange for the capital raised.

The vast majority of bonds have a maturity date that’s set when the bond is issued. On a bond’s maturity date, the borrower fulfills its debt obligation by paying bond holders the final interest payment and the bond’s face value, called par value.

Generally, a bond that matures in one to three years is referred to as a short-term bond. Medium- or intermediate-term bonds are generally those that mature in four to 10 years, and long-term bonds are those with maturities greater than 10 years. Not all bonds reach maturity. [Callable bonds](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/callable-bonds-your-issuer-may-come-calling), which allow the issuer to retire a bond before it matures, are common.

A bond’s coupon—or annual interest—is generally paid out semiannually. The coupon is set at issuance and tied to a bond's face or par value. It’s quoted as a percentage of par. For instance, a bond with a par value of $1,000 and an annual interest rate of 4.5 percent has a coupon rate of 4.5 percent ($45). An [[Investor]] in a bond with a $45 annual coupon that pays interest semiannually can expect to receive a $22.50 interest payment twice per year.

### Bottom Line

Bonds and bond funds can be an important component of a diversified investment portfolio. They can be helpful for anyone concerned about capital preservation and income generation and can help partially offset the risks that come with equity investing.
