A broker is any person engaged in the business of buying or selling [[securities]] for the account of others. A dealer is any person engaged in the business of buying or selling securities, but for their own account. Identifying when a person is acting as a broker or a dealer is important because generally broker-dealers must register with the [[SEC]].
