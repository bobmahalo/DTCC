In March 1792, twenty-four of New York's leading merchants met secretly at Corre's Hotel to discuss ways to bring order to the [[Securities]] business. Two months later, on May 17, 1792, these men signed a document called the Buttonwood Agreement, named after their traditional meeting place under a buttonwood tree.

By 1793 there were too many [[Broker]]s involved to meet under a tree. So they took space in an elaborate structure on the corner of [[Wall Street]] and Water streets, called the Tontine Coffee House. Their new venture was to become the nation's principal securities marketplace - the New York Stock Exchange [[NYSE]], which today is only a few blocks from where the old buttonwood tree once grew.
