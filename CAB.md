Capital Acquisition Broker (“CAB”)
CABs are [[Broker]]-dealers that help promote [[Capital Formation]] through specified functions, essentially acting as placement agents for sales of unregistered [[Securities]] to institutional investors; acting as [[intermediary]]s in connection with the change of control of privately held companies; and advising companies and private equity funds on capital raising and corporate restructuring. Member firms that meet the CAB criteria may elect to be governed by the CAB Rules. CABs’ specified functions do not include broader broker-dealer activities, such as accepting customers’ trading orders, carrying customer accounts, handling customers’ funds or securities, or engaging in proprietary trading or [[Market Making]]. Given their limited institutional business model, CABs are subject to fewer restrictions on particular activities (such as advertising) and are not subject to sales practice requirements for particular products that CABs do not offer, such as variable insurance contracts or investment company securities. CAB Supervisory Requirements CABs are subject to less extensive supervisory requirements than non-CAB member firms; however, pursuant to CAB Rule 311, CABs are subject to FINRA’s core supervisory requirements. By subjecting CABs to specified provisions of FINRA [[Rule 3110]], CAB Rule 311 requires CABs to establish and maintain a system to supervise the activities of each associated person that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations and applicable [[FINRA]] rules.
