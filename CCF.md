For the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ([[DTCC]]), CCF and [[CCFII]] are legacy data transmission protocols that enable DTCC [[Participant]]s to send and receive files from DTCC's automated systems

. The primary difference between the two is their formatting, with CCF-II being a more modern version that includes trailer records. 

CCF (Computer-to-Computer Facility)

- **A proprietary protocol:** CCF is a proprietary file format used by DTCC's subsidiaries, primarily the Depository Trust Company ([[DTC]]), to exchange information with member firms.
- **Record-based files:** In CCF, participants receive a data file with a single header record followed by the detailed transaction records.
- **Used for various functions:** CCF is used for a wide variety of functions, including securities processing and transmitting information on daily collateral loan balances.


Computer to Computer Facility
CCF stands for Computer to Computer File Transmission, a proprietary file format used by DTCC for sending and receiving data between financial institutions. [[DTCC]] Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is the central financial market infrastructure that provides services for clearing, settlement, and reporting of [[securities]] and [[derivatives]] transactions.  This is a technical term for a data format. Think of it as a language that two computer systems use to exchange information in a structured way.
