Computer to Computer Facility
CCF stands for Computer to Computer File Transmission, a proprietary file format used by DTCC for sending and receiving data between financial institutions. [[DTCC]] Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is the central financial market infrastructure that provides services for clearing, settlement, and reporting of [[securities]] and [[derivatives]] transactions.  This is a technical term for a data format. Think of it as a language that two computer systems use to exchange information in a structured way.

[[CCFII]] replaces CCF.
