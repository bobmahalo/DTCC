Central Certificate Service. It just didnt have the same hidden meaning as [[Cede & Co]].

#### Formation of the Central Certificate Service (1968)

In immediate response to the [[Paperwork Crisis]], regulators and industry [[participant]]s studied and adopted alternative settlement systems and other potential options which might reduce or eliminate the problems associated with the traditional process for transferring [[Physical Securities Certificates]]. First, in June 1968, the [[NYSE]] established the Central Certificate Service (“CCS”) as a division of the [[Stock Clearing Corporation]]. [[Broker]]-dealers and banks who were members of the NYSE were permitted to deposit their certificated [[Securities]] with CCS, which would hold the certificates in [[custody]] and transfer them into the name of a CCS [[Nominee]]. The certificated securities deposited by that [[Member]] would be represented by an appropriate [[Book-entry]] credit reflected in that [[Member]]'s account at CCS. Because all securities held by CCS were registered in its nominee's name, deliveries of securities between CCS members could be effected by appropriate credits and debits to the members' securities accounts rather than by physical delivery of certificates. In this manner members' accounts would be debited and credited to reflect transactions among them, but the [[Registered Owner]] of the securities—CCS's nominee—would never change. Movement of certificates was thus eliminated, resulting in their “immobilization.”  At the time, CCS was the most prominent example of the central [[securities depository]] model discussed below in Section II.B.2. In 1970, CCS opened its services to members of the American Stock Exchange, and in 1973 CCS changed its name to the Depository Trust Company (“[[DTC]]”).
