Customer Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian

FAST Agents currently use the Custodian Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (“CDWC”)

function on [[PTS]] (or the TA Direct Deposit/Withdrawal function on [[PBS]]), to view and approve

the [[DWAC]] transactions of [[Participant]]s. In addition, [[FAST]] Agents can also use the optional

[[DWAC]] Centralized Billing through [[PTS]]/[[PBS]] to automate the billing and collection of pass-

through [[DWAC]] fees charged to [[Participant]]s by the [[FAST]] Agent. Participants currently use the

Participant Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (“[[PDWC]]”) function on [[PTS]] (or the Part Direct

Deposit/Withdrawal functions on PBS) to view and to input deposit and withdrawal instructions

for their DWAC transactions.

Pursuant to the proposed rule change, the DWAC functionality currently used by

Participants and FAST Agents through PTS/PBS will migrate to the [[SPA]] system. As of March

28, 2024, FAST Agents and Participants will be required to conduct these activities through the

SPA system, which is accessible through the [[DTCC]] Portal at MyDTCC.com. In addition,

pursuant to the proposed rule change, APIs for the SPA system would be available in connection

with DWAC.
