The CNS System is [[NSCC]]’s core netting, allotting and fail-control engine. Within CNS, each security is netted to one position per [[Member]], with NSCC as its central counterparty ([[Novation]]). 


Within CNS, NSCC acts as the central counterparty for clearance and settlement for virtually all [[Broker]]-to-broker [[Equity]], corporate and municipal bond and unit investment trust trading in the United States. CNS settles trades from the nation's major [[Stock Exchange]]s, markets and other sources and nets these transactions to one security position per [[Member]] per day. Typically, NSCC’s trade guarantee will attach to CNS transactions that reach point of validation. 

CNS processes include an automated [[Book-entry]] accounting system that centralizes [[settlement]] and maintains an orderly flow of security and money balances. 

Throughout the CNS processing cycle the system generates reports that provide Members with a complete record of security and money positions and related information. 

While NSCC provides final settlement instructions to its Members each day, the payment and movement of [[Securities]] ownership occurs at [[DTCC]]'s subsidiary, The Depository Trust Company ([[DTC]]). As DTCC's depository, DTC also eliminates the movement of securities by providing book-entry deliveries, which transfer the ownership of securities electronically.
