Comprehensive Securities Depository System
Throughout 1970 and much of 1971, [[BASIC]] acted on 14 projects designed to reduce the costs and improve the process of [[Securities]] operations. The most significant of these was the establishment of a Comprehensive Securities Depository System(CSDS) expanding upon the [[NYSE]]'s [[Central Certificate Service]]. In September of 1971, [[BASIC]] announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding among the New York and American Stock Exchanges, the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]], and the eleven member banks of the New York Clearing House Association, toward this end. Regional markets and banks soon joined in the process and a National Coordinating Group (NCG) was formed. The planning to implement the elements of the Memorandum of Understanding was begun immediately, but in an atmosphere of uncertainty due to events unfolding at the Federal level.

_Plans for establishing CSDS were outlined to House Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance by Exchange Executive Vice President Richard B. Howland among other panelists taking part in the October I971 hearings._
