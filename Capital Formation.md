A vital component of economic growth is the ability of businesses of all sizes to efficiently raise capital. This allows businesses to launch, expand, modernize, innovate and create jobs. ***In turn,*** well-functioning [[Securities]] markets that promote [[Issuer]] and investor confidence are essential to the capital-formation process.

Throughout the lifecycle of this process, [[FINRA]] members are central to both public and private markets—[[Underwriting]] [[public offering]]s, advising companies on capital raising and corporate restructuring, acting as placement agents for some sales of unregistered securities, operating funding portals, and publishing research reports to educate and inform investors.[4](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/23-09#_edn4) In regulating these members, FINRA promotes market integrity and investor protection in a manner that supports the important role our capital markets play in the U.S. financial system. FINRA is committed to fostering vibrant capital markets in which everyone can participate with confidence.
