Capital Acquisition Broker (“[[CAB]]”)
CABs are [[Broker]]-dealers that help promote capital formation through specified functions, essentially acting as placement agents for sales of unregistered [[Securities]] to institutional [[Investor]]s; acting as [[intermediary]]s in connection with the change of control of privately held companies; and advising companies and private equity funds on capital raising and corporate restructuring. Member firms that meet the CAB criteria may elect to be governed by the CAB Rules. CABs’ specified functions do not include broader broker-dealer activities, such as accepting customers’ trading orders, carrying customer accounts, handling customers’ funds or securities, or engaging in proprietary trading or [[Market Making]].

A vital component of economic growth is the ability of businesses of all sizes to efficiently raise capital. This allows businesses to launch, expand, modernize, innovate and create jobs. ***In turn,*** well-functioning [[Securities]] markets that promote [[Issuer]] and [[Investor]] confidence are essential to the capital-formation process.

Throughout the lifecycle of this process, [[FINRA]] members are central to both public and private markets—[[Underwriting]] [[public offering]]s, advising companies on capital raising and corporate restructuring, acting as placement agents for some sales of unregistered securities, operating funding portals, and publishing research reports to educate and inform [[Investor]]s.[4](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/23-09#_edn4) In regulating these members, FINRA promotes market integrity and [[Investor]] protection in a manner that supports the important role our capital markets play in the U.S. financial system. FINRA is committed to fostering vibrant capital markets in which everyone can participate with confidence.
