The nominee of the [[DTC]] this little known company owns over 80% of all securities in the U.S. [[Stock Exchange]]. 


The minimum requirement for a [[Participant]] to request a Security to become eligible at [[DTC]] is the submission of an offering document and a completed eligibility request in UW SOURCE or UWC. (_See_ Section I (A), Eligibility Requirements.) In addition, [[Issuer]]s of [[BEO]] issues must submit to DTC a fully executed [[LOR]] on DTC’s preprinted form. This LOR represents the Issuer’s agreement to comply with the requirements set forth in this [[OA]], as amended from time to time. BEO [[Securities]] are DTC-eligible securities for which (i) [[Physical Securities Certificates]] are not available to [[Investor]]s and (ii) DTC, through its [[Nominee]], Cede & Co., will hold the entire balance of the offering, either at DTC or through a [[FAST]] Agent in DTC’s Fast Automated Securities Transfer (“FAST”) program. Issuers of BEO securities, that are either FAST or where a physical master certificate is delivered to DTC, must submit to DTC a LOR among the Issuer, its Agent (as applicable) and DTC, prior to such issue being determined to be eligible. For corporate and municipal securities, there are two acceptable forms of LOR: a Blanket Issuer Letter of Representations (“BLOR”) or an Issuer Letter of Representations (“ILOR”). A BLOR is Issuer-specific and, except with respect to MMI securities, applicable to all DTC-eligible securities (debt and/or equity) of the same Issuer. Once a BLOR is on file for an Issuer, a new BLOR is not required for future issuances of non-MMI unless the Issuer’s name changes (in which case an opinion of counsel may also be required). An ILOR may be used for discrete issuances, and is applicable only to that issue of securities, such as trust issuances. In all LORs, Issuers represent that they will comply with this OA, as amended from time to time.

## The Depository Trust Company (DTC)

[[DTCC]]'s subsidiary, **The Depository Trust Company ([[DTC]]),** established in 1973, was created to reduce costs and provide clearing and settlement efficiencies by immobilizing [[Securities]] and making "[[Book-entry]]" changes to ownership of the securities.

DTC brings efficiency to the securities industry by retaining [[Custody]] of more than 1.4 million active securities issues valued at US$87.1 trillion, including securities issued in the US and more than 131 countries and territories.

DTC provides securities movements for [[NSCC]]'s net settlements, and settlement for institutional trades (which typically involve money and securities transfers between [[Custodians]] banks and [[Broker]]/dealers), as well as money market instruments.
