Companies can choose to “list” their [[Securities]] for trading on a national securities exchange, such as the [[NASDQ]] [[Stock Exchange]] or the New York Stock Exchange ([[NYSE]]). Find a list of [national securities exchanges](https://www.sec.gov/rules-regulations/self-regulatory-organization-rulemaking "Self-Regulatory Organization Rulemaking") that have been registered with the [[SEC]].

Listing securities may provide increased [[Liquidity]] for a company’s shareholders by making it easier for shareholders to sell their securities to other [[Investor]]s in the public market, sometimes called [secondary trading](https://www.sec.gov/jargon-z#SM).

Before a company’s stock can begin trading on an exchange, the company must meet that exchange’s minimum financial and non-financial requirements, or [listing standards](https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/goingpublic/listingstandards). The company also must file an [Exchange Act registration statement](https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/goingpublic/exchangeactreporting) and become a reporting company. Once listed on an exchange, a company must continue to meet that exchange’s continued listing standards and SEC reporting requirements. If a company fails to meet the continued listing standards, the exchange may remove or “delist” that company’s securities from the exchange.
