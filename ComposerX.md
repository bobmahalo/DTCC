**New York/London/Hong Kong/Singapore/Sydney/Tokyo/Abu Dhabi, February 4, 2025** ‒ The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation ([[DTCC]]), the premier post-trade market infrastructure for the global financial services industry, today announced **[ComposerX](http://www.dtcc.com/digital-assets/composerx)**, a comprehensive suite of platforms designed to streamline [[Token]] creation and settlement with the objective of accelerating [[Digital Asset]] adoption throughout the financial ecosystem. 

ComposerX is a complete, end-to-end suite for managing digital assets through their full lifecycle – including issuance, distribution, servicing, and reporting. ComposerX provides powerful transaction, account and inventory management capabilities, scalable data management tools, and an open smart contract framework for [[Tokenization]] that’s designed to automate complex financial processes and enable [[asset]] discoverability with reconcilable, self-describing data.

Meaningful adoption of digital assets goes beyond [[asset]] creation on a [[Blockchain]]. Firms also require an on-chain framework for data management that powers business decisions, risk management, and reporting.
