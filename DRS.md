The Direct Registration System was created in 1996.

DRS enables investors to elect to hold their assets in [[book entry]] form directly with the [[issuer]] by leveraging [[DTC]]’s connectivity with [[FAST]] [[transfer agent]]s. Through DTC’s DRS Service, assets can be electronically transferred to and from the transfer agent and broker/dealer to easily move shares in and out of DRS.
