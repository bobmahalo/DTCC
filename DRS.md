The Direct Registration System was created in 1996

DRS enables investors to elect to hold their assets in book entry form directly with the issuer by leveraging DTC’s connectivity with [FAST transfer agents](https://www.dtcc.com/asset-services/agent-services/fast). Through DTC’s DRS Service, assets can be electronically transferred to and from the transfer agent and broker/dealer to easily move shares in and out of DRS.
