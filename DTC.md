The Depository Trust Company,  established in 1973, , was created to reduce costs and provide clearing and settlement efficiencies by immobilizing securities and making "[[Book-entry]]" changes to ownership of the [[Securities]].

DTC brings efficiency to the securities industry by retaining [[Custody]] of more than 1.4 million active securities issues valued at US $87.1 trillion, including securities issued in the US and more than 131 countries and territories.

DTC provides securities movements for [[NSCC]]'s net settlements, and settlement for institutional trades (which typically involve money and securities transfers between custodian banks and broker/dealers), as well as money market instruments.

DTC's core services include:

If an [[Issuer]] is not DTC eligible, then its [[shares]] cannot be transferred between brokerage accounts electronically, which basically means its shares cannot be traded easily.   Major Exchanges such as [[NYSE]] and [[NASDAQ]] require DTC eligibility.
