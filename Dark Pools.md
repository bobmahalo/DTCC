Dark poolsÂ are alternative trading systems that allow institutional investors to execute large trades without causing significant market impact. Unlike traditional exchanges, where orders are visible to all participants, dark pools operate in a more discreet manner. This opacity is precisely what gives them their name.

The concept of dark pools emerged following regulatory changes by the [[SEC]] in 1979. The first official dark pool, "[After Hours](https://www.cheddarflow.com/blog/can-you-trade-options-after-hours/)," was established by Instinet in 1986. Since then, these private markets have grown in popularity and importance.

Dark pools mitigate this issue by allowing institutional investors to trade large blocks of securities without broadcasting their intentions to the wider market.

1. Lack of transparency

2. Potential conflicts of interest

3. Disadvantages for retail traders
