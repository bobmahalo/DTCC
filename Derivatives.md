Another word for options contracts. The primary driver of [[Liquidity]]. The method that has allowed for [[Synthetic Share]] creation by future dated expirations.

Their origins are often debated.
This text is the 48t law out of 282 contained in the Code of Hammurabi. Hammurabi was a
king of Babylon who reigned, according to some sources, from around 1792 to 1750 BC.
Hammurabi engraved the eponymous code on stone steles. This code counts among the oldest written body of laws known today and covers almost all the aspects of civil as well as commercial laws of that time. It deals to a great extent with contractual matters, establishing for example the wages to be paid to an ox-driver or to a doctor. It is renowned to be the most
complete code of the Mesopotamian laws that have been conserved until today. In terms of contracts, one may recognise in this 48th law a kind of contract that once translated into a more modern language would stipulate the following: A farmer who has a mortgage on his property is required to make annual interest payments in the form of grain, however, in the event of a crop failure, this farmer has the right not to pay anything and the creditor has no alternative but to forgive the interest due. Experts in the field of derivatives would classify such a contract as a put option. In another word: If the harvest is plentiful and the farmer has enough grain to pay his mortgage interest, the put option would expire worthless. If his harvest fell short, however, he would exercise his right to walk away from making the
payment.


In Ancient Mesopotamia, with a view to encouraging trade and securing the supply of commodities, both in time and geographical distance, the rulers' codes actually required that purchases, sales and other commercial agreements be in written form in order to provide buyers and sellers with the greatest possible legal certainty to engage in trade. The purpose was to minimise the "your word against mine" maxim in case of disputes. Merchants of the city-states of the region thus developed, in addition to the codes, commercial contracts. Records of such contracts have been found in cuneiform script on clay tablets. Some types of contracts were arrangements on the future delivery of grain that stipulated for instance before planting that a seller would deliver a certain quantity of grain for a price paid at the time of contracting. Such types of contracts not only dealt with grain but also with all sorts of
commodities. Some of the contracts were "bearer" securities that could be transferred to third parties maturity. These types of contracts
had the features of today's forwards and were used across borders. By about 1,400 BC, cuneiform script in the Babylonian language was even used in Egypt to record transactions with Crete, Cyprus, the Aegean Islands, Assyria and the Hittites. During
the Ancient Mesopotamian period, derivatives contained, most of the time, a description of the parties, a description of the asset to be transferred, the price of the transaction, the date of delivery and sometimes a list and even a description of witnesses. Trading took place at the gates of the cities, at the quaysides in port cities and in the city centres, more precisely at the temples. In addition to their religious, political and military functions, the temples played a significant commercial role. They were directly and indirectly involved in trade and as a consequence in derivatives transactions. They functioned as trade repositories, were parties to contracts and offered warehouse facilities. They also provided quantity and quality measurement standards. Some functions of central clearing already appeared in Ancient Mesopotamia where temples operated as clearinghouses. Long-distance trade, including
derivatives was regulated and supervised by the government.


A Call Option in ancient Greece.
A subsequent trace of derivatives in history can be found in Aristotle's Politics. Aristotle tells the story of Thales, another philosopher but also mathematician, who lived from around 625 to 550 BC in Miletus, which was one of the major cities of Ancient Greece. During wintertime, Thales predicted an unusually large olive harvest. He seized the opportunity to negotiate with the olive press owners the right, but not the
obligation, to hire all the olive presses in the region for the following autumn. To secure this right, Thales made a cash deposit. It happened that the harvest was as predicted and the demand for the use of olive presses soared. Thales was then able to lease the presses at a substantial premium and made a fortune. Aristotle sought to demonstrate how easy it was for philosophers to become rich if they so desired, despite it not being their aim,
but he did not seek to create a financial product that experts would today name a call option.


Another example of derivatives is the monti share. Monti shares were issued by Italian merchant cities in order to raise money. These shares were promises by the governments to repay debts in the future. It began as the sale of future government revenues to investors. By
the 13th century, these shares were traded in secondary markets and were even used as a means of payment for goods or services instead of cash. Because they were perfectly fungible, these shares were the ideal instrument to develop contracts markets. However, these shares could not be sold freely, in particular to foreigners, and prices fluctuated with the fortunes of
the cities.

At the dawn of the modern world, Antwerp became the location where local and international traders gathered to conduct business all year round. Antwerp opened an exchange where regulation was kept to a minimum. Antwerp as a trading and financial centre preceded major cities such as Amsterdam and London, where examples of derivatives are not scarce.

In Antwerp, there was a widespread use of contracts for future delivery which mainly took the form of bills of exchange. These contracts were structured as options related to, among other things, delivery dates and quality at delivery. Some options offered the possibility for the buyers to take up the delivery at the agreed conditions or to pay a fixed fee instead of taking the delivery. The concentration of trade and the liquidity of the commodity market furthered the development of a secondary market. Many merchants began to move from trading commodities into dealing with bills of exchange. They realised that there was no need to settle the contracts by delivering the underlying commodity. They did not need to store or to transport any commodities and there was less risk and a better chance of profit. The regulatory framework put in place by Charles V between 1537 and 1539 recognised the transferability of bills of exchange to third persons prior to the maturity date of the underlying commodity and also recognised the negotiability of these bills. Charles V condoned the development of a contract market where trading of contracts for future delivery was a source of speculative profit. There is also evidence that contracts for difference, where a losing party could compensate the winning party for the difference between the delivery price and the spot price at the time of settlement, were largely used. Because they gave traders too much leverage to speculate, these contracts were banned in 1541. Despite the ban in Antwerp, contracts for differences continued to be used in Hamburg, Rouen and Amsterdam


even the ancients had difficulty enforcing rules against [[SHF]]. 
In 1608, Isaac le Maire, an Antwerp merchant formed a syndicate and organised a first short-selling attack with a view to depressing the value of the company. The syndicate borrowed shares and then sold them. The attack could only be profitable if the syndicate could repurchase shares and return them to the owner at a lower price in the future. The raid of the syndicate was apparently successful at least in the short term, but it failed to force down the long-term share price. Several traders who also engaged to speculate on their own account went bankrupt as they had to buy shares at prices much higher than the ones they negotiated for future delivery. One of the consequences of the attack was the ban on short selling in 1610. However, it appeared that it was not effectively enforced.
