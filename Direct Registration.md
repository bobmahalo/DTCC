To hold a security in direct registration means the security is registered in your name on the [[Issuer]]’s books and is held for you in [[Book-entry]] form by a [[Transfer Agent]] to the issuer that has been admitted as Direct Registration System (“[[DRS]]”)](https://www.dtcc.com/settlement-and-asset-services/securities-processing/direct-registration-system "(opens in a new window)")eligible by [[DTC]].

Holding in such direct registration form (also commonly referred to as DRS form) allows investors to transfer [[Securities]] to and from the transfer agent and a broker-dealer. If an issuer offers direct registration for its securities, you can choose to be registered directly on the books of the issuer (maintained by its transfer agent) regardless of whether you bought your securities through a broker-dealer. Direct registration allows you to have your security registered in your name on the books of the issuer without the need for a [[Physical Securities Certificates]] to serve as evidence of your ownership. While you will not receive a certificate, you will receive a transaction advice in connection with any transactions, as well as periodic account statements, dividends, annual reports, [[Proxy]] materials related to stockholder meetings, and other [[Entitlement]]s or communications directly from the issuer or its transfer agent.
