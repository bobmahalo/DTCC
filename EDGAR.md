Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval

EDGAR, the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, is the primary system for [[Companies]]([[Issuer]]s) and others submitting documents under the [[Securities Act of 1933]], the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], the [[Trust Indenture Act of 1939]], and the [[Investment Company Act]] of 1940. 

Containing millions of company and individual filings, EDGAR benefits [[Investor]]s, corporations, and the U.S. economy overall by increasing the efficiency, transparency, and fairness of the [[Securities]] markets. The system processes about 4,700 filings per day, serves up 3,000 terabytes of data to the public annually, and accommodates 40,000 new filers per year on average.
