An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is a security that trades on an exchange as an [[Equity]] that seeks to replicate the performance of an index without the need to purchase the underlying components.

The [[NSCC]] process for clearing ETFs includes the ability to review, either on-line or in a data file, the ETFâ€™s portfolio constituents which is also used to automate the creation and redemption of ETF [[shares]] and their subsequent settlement.
