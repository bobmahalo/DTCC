[[DWAC]] allows [[Participant]]s to instruct [[DTC]] regarding deposit and withdrawal transactions being made directly via a FAST [[transfer agent]]. The FAST system eliminates the movement of physical [[securities]] [[certificates]] for transfers of securities registered in the name of DTC’s nominee, [[Cede & Co]], on the transfer agent’s books. DTC and its FAST transfer agents reconcile the results of participants’ deposit and withdrawal activities electronically on a daily basis.
