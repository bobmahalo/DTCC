A Follow-on Registered Offering(FRO) or [[APO]] is a registered offering of [[Securities]] by a public company (I[[Issuer]]) whose securities already trade in the [[Secondary market]] (e.g., [[Capital Formation]] for various corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures, operations, or acquisitions). The FRO may also involve an offering of securities by the issuerâ€™s insiders or other existing shareholders.
