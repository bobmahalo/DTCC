Form S-3 is the registration statement that the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] ([[SEC]]) requires reporting company [[Issuer]]s to file in order to issue [[shelf offering]]s.

Generally, under Section 5 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]], an issuer must file a registration statement to offer securities to the public. [[Rule 415]] of the Securities Act, however, provides “[[Securities]] may be registered for an offering to be made on a continuous or delayed basis in the future,” i.e. it enables shelf offerings. Issuers file shelf offerings with Form S-3. 

Form S-3 requires less disclosure than many other registration statements, but issuers must satisfy rigorous requirements to qualify to file a Form S-3. The issuer must have timely filed all its periodic reports. The issuer must have met all debt and dividend obligations in the prior 12 months. The issuer must additionally have a public float greater than $75 million.
