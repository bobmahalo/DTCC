On October 13, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ([[SEC]] or Commission), adopted [[Rule 13f-21]] (Final Rule) under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] (Exchange Act) and Form SHO, which for the first time will require institutional investment managers to report to the SEC extensive information on certain “large” [[short position]]s and [[Short Sale]] activity on a monthly basis. The SEC will then use this data to make publicly available aggregate data about short positions and short sale activity in individual [[securities]]. 

The SEC also adopted an amendment to the national market system plan ([[Reg NMS]] Plan) governing the [[Consolidated Audit Trail]] ([[CAT]]), under which CAT reporting firms must indicate whether an order is a short sale effected by a [[Market Maker]] in connection with [[Bonafide Market Making]] activities for which the “bona fide market making exception” to the [[Reg SHO]] “[[locate]]” requirement is claimed.

These new SEC reporting requirements will impose significant operational and compliance burdens on a number of market participants, most notably managers of private funds and [[Family Office]]s, as well as [[Broker]]-dealers. In certain respects, the new short disclosure requirements are much more substantial and onerous than the current disclosure of long positions by Institutional Investment Managers on [[Form 13F]] as well as [[Beneficial Owner]]ship reporting on Schedules 13D and 13G. To comply with new Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO, Institutional Investment Managers will need to monitor on a daily basis their short sale activity in equity securities in order to calculate whether their “gross short position” exceeds the identified thresholds, as described further below. In addition, for each equity security in which the gross short position exceeds an applicable threshold, the Institutional Investment Manager will be required to perform onerous calculations to determine, and report, the “net” trading activity in such security on each day of the month.

**_Summary of Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO_**

- Rule 13f-2 will require an Institutional Investment Manager to file, within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month, a Form SHO report via the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ([[EDGAR]]) for
    - each equity security that is of a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act or for which the issuer is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (Reporting Company Issuer) over which the Institutional Investment Manager and all accounts over which it has investment discretion with respect to either (i) a monthly average gross short position at the close of regular trading hours in the equity security with a value of USD $10 million or more or (ii) a monthly average gross short position at the close of regular trading hours as a percentage of the [[Issuer]]’s total shares outstanding of 2.5% or more
    - each equity security that is of a class of securities of an issuer that is not a Reporting Company Issuer over which the Institutional Investment Manager and all accounts over which it has investment discretion with respect to a gross short position with a U.S. dollar value of $500,000 or more at the close of regular trading on any settlement date during the calendar month (notably, and different from the calculation for Reporting Company Issuers, such calculation is **_not_** determined based on the monthly average gross short position but rather will be triggered if exceeded on any settlement date during the reporting month)
- Institutional Investment Managers, with respect to short positions in reported equity securities meeting the above-described thresholds, will be required to report on Form SHO information concerning the end-of-month gross short position, as well as detailed information on the Institutional Investment Manager’s daily “net” activity, in each reported equity security.
- The SEC expects that it will make public aggregated information derived from data reported on Form SHO within one month after the end of the reporting calendar month.
