[[DTC]] holds the deposited [[Securities]] in “fungible bulk,” meaning that there are no specifically identifiable [[shares]] directly owned by the DTC [[Participant]]s. Rather, each DTC participant holds a [[Pro Rata]] interest or position in the aggregate number of shares of a particular [[Issuer]] held at DTC. Correspondingly, each customer of a DTC participant – such as an individual investor – owns a pro rata interest in the shares in which the DTC participant has a pro rata interest.
