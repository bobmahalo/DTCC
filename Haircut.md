When a lender seeks to make a collateralized loan of some liquid [[Asset]] from a [[Borrower]] the value of the [[Collateral]] is subject to a discount or “haircut” to ensure that in the event of a default the collateral can be liquidated to repay the loan fully; since the price of the collateralized [[asset]] may have declined in the intervening period. The typical way these haricuts are calculated in the private sector—as described in Garcia and Gen¸cay (2006, section 6.2)—is via an examination of the historical volatility of the collateral and calculating a haircut to minimize the loss of the lender. This is an appropriate methodology for a market [[Participant]] who has little market power and where the net amounts of collateral or the liquid asset are fixed.
