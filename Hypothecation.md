[[Rule 8c-1]] generally prohibits a [[broker]]-dealer from using its customers' [[securities]] as [[Collateral]] to finance its own trading, speculating, or [[Underwriting]] transactions. More specifically, [[Rule 8c-1]] states three main principles: (1) a [[Broker]]-dealer is prohibited from commingling the [[Securities]] of different customers as [[Collateral]] for a loan without the consent of each customer; (2) a broker-dealer cannot commingle customers' securities with its own securities under the same pledge; and (3) a broker-dealer can only pledge its customers' securities to the extent that customers are in debt to the broker-dealer. Additionally, Rule 8c-1 requires broker-dealers to make certain written notifications to pledgees in connection with such use of customer securities as collateral.

The information required by [[Rule 8c-1]] is necessary for the execution of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]'s mandate under [[The Exchange Act]] to prevent broker-dealers from hypothecating or arranging for the hypothecation of any securities carried for the account of any customer under certain circumstances. In addition, the information required by Rule 8c-1 provides important [[Investor]] protections.
