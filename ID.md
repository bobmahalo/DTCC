# ID Net Service Retirement

As previously announced on August 8, 2023, in Important Notice number 18852-23, the

National Securities Clearing Corporation ([[NSCC]]) and the Depository Trust Company ([[DTC]])

are retiring its ID Net service, subject to regulatory approval. This Notice serves as a final

reminder to ID Net subscribers that November 15, 2024, will be the final settlement date for ID

Net transactions and that affirmed [[DTCC]] Institutional Trades with settlement dates beyond

November 15 will settle trade-for-trade at [[DTC]].

In preparation for ID Net’s retirement, DTC will take the following steps.

• On October 1, 2024, decommission support of ID Net in its PSE test environment.

• Pending regulatory approval, offboard existing clients from our production environment

who have not had any ID Net activity in the past 12 months.

[[DTCC]] will continue to fully support ID Net through November 15, 2024, but will also work

directly with existing clients interested in off-boarding prior to the official retirement date.
