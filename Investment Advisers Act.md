This law regulates investment advisers. With certain exceptions, this Act requires that firms or sole practitioners compensated for advising others about [[Securities]] investments must register with the [[SEC]] and conform to regulations designed to protect [[Investor]]s. Since the Act was amended in 1996 and 2010, generally only advisers who have at least $100 million of assets under management or advise a registered investment company must register with the Commission. Other investment advisers typically register with the state in which the investment adviser maintains its principal place of business.
