If you want to get a visual of the chain, you have to understand there is not a single ledger. the transfer agent sits at the top, who maintains the records for the issuer, showing individual investors(DRS) and Cede & Co. Then the DTCC has a ledger listing participants who have claim to a certain number of shares who also maintain their own ledger listing which brokers who have claim to a certain number of shares who maintain their own ledger showing which investors are holding a certain number of shares. at each level, the ledger above has no visibility of the ledger below.
