In 1938 Congress passed an Act' to amend the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] by adding, _inter alia,_ a new section. The object of this amendment, the Maloney Act, was to encourage over-the-counter ([[OTC]]) dealers to organize and regulate their activities under governmental supervision. The scheme, "a unique experiment in supervised self-regulation," was hailed as an "especially provocative exercise of governmental power by a private organization." It was to be the instrument which supplies exactly what voluntary self-regulatory attempts have heretofore lacked, power within the business itself to enforce rules and regulations requiring conduct higher in standard than even that which the government could effectively require by law. Under the Maloney Act, more than one association of [[Broker]] dealers could apply for recognition, yet only one didâ€”the [[National Association of Securities Dealers]], Inc. (hereinafter referred to as [[NASD]]). Today the NASD embraces almost all the [[Broker]] dealers in the United States.
