### ESSENTIALS

- A common type of investment company, mutual funds are open-end funds, meaning that investors can purchase and redeem shares in the funds on a daily basis based on the net asset value (NAV) of their shares.
- Mutual funds pool the money of many [[Investor]]s to purchase a range of [[Securities]] to meet specified objectives, such as growth, income or both.
- Mutual funds can offer cost-effective diversification.
- Each mutual fund has a different investment objective. Some funds invest in a particular product, such as [[Stock]]s or bonds. Some focus on a particular industry or region. Others seek to replicate a market index.
- All mutual funds have fees and expenses. Use [[FINRA]]’s [Fund Analyzer](https://tools.finra.org/fund_analyzer/)to analyze and compare the costs of owning specific funds.
- A mutual fund may have different share classes with different costs. Your investment professional might receive higher (or lower) commissions or payments for the sale of one share class relative to another.
- It’s important to read a mutual fund’s prospectus to learn about its objectives, investments, strategies and costs.

Mutual funds are a popular way to invest in [[Securities]]. Because mutual funds can offer built-in [diversification](https://www.finra.org/investors/investing/investing-basics/asset-allocation-diversification) and professional management, they offer certain advantages over purchasing individual [[Stock]]s and [[bonds]]. But, like investing in any security, investing in a mutual fund involves certain risks, including the possibility that you might lose money.

A mutual fund is a type of investment company, known as an open-end fund, that pools money from many [[Investor]]s and invests it based on specific investment goals. The mutual fund raises money by selling its own shares to investors. The money is used to purchase a portfolio of stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instruments, other securities or assets, or some combination of these investments. Each share represents an ownership slice of the fund and gives the investor a proportional right, based on the number of shares they own, to income and capital gains that the fund generates from its investments.

The particular investments a fund makes are determined by its objectives and, in the case of an actively managed fund, by the investment style and skill of the fund's professional manager or managers. The holdings of the mutual fund are known as its underlying investments, and the performance of those investments, minus fund fees, determine the fund's investment return.

All of the details about a mutual fund—including its investment strategy, risk profile, performance history, management and fees—are provided in its prospectus. You should always read the prospectus before investing in a fund. [[FINRA]]
