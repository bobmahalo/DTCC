## National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)

[[DTCC]]'s subsidiary, **National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)**, established in 1976, provides clearing, settlement, risk management, central counterparty services and a guarantee of completion for certain transactions for virtually all [[Broker]]-to-broker trades involving equities, corporate and municipal debt, American depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds([[ETF]]), and unit investment trusts([[UIT]]). 

NSCC also nets trades and payments among its [[Participant]]s, reducing the value of payments that need to be exchanged by an average of 98% each day. NSCC generally clears and settles trades on a T+1 basis.

NSCC is regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

To extend its [[Participant]]s' ability to effectively use other industry utilities, [[DTC]] collaborated with the regional exchanges and their clearing corporations and depositories to build the necessary interfaces. At the end of the decade, these interfaces included: the Midwest Securities Trust Company in Chicago, the New England [[Securities Depository]] Trust Company in Boston, the Pacific [[Securities Depository]] Trust Company in San Francisco, and The Philadelphia Depository Trust Company. Since its inception, DTC had beenclosely linked to the clearing corporations of the [[NYSE]], Amex and [[NASD]] and had collaborated in the implementation of the Continuous Net Settlement System ([[CNS]]) developed for their members. The three clearing corporations combined in 1977 to form the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), with which DTC continues to work in close partnership.
