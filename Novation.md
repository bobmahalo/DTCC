The process of substituting an existing contract with a replacement contract.

## T+1 IMPLEMENTATION

The successful implementation of the T+1 settlement cycle across North America for U.S. cash equities, corporate debt and unit investment trusts ([[UIT]]), led to a significant decrease in the [[NSCC]] Clearing Fund, reducing it by an average of $3.0 billion (23%) from the prior three-month average value, leading to increased operational efficiency and reduced risk for market [[Participant]]s. On an average day in 2024, [[DTCC]] netted down $2.2 trillion dollars in total trade activity to $33.5 billion dollars resulting in a 98% netting efficiency rate.

## TRACTION WITH SFT

In mid-2024, with the cooperation of Provable Markets (an Automated Trade Submitter), [[NSCC]] completed the first [[Novation]] of a pre-existing bilateral stock loan utilizing NSCC's Security Financing Transaction Service ([[SFT]]). In the first use case, an outstanding bilateral transaction was routed through the [[ATS]] to NSCC’s [[SFT]] clearing service for novation and processing. This transaction was completed without having the borrower return the underlying security back to the lender through [[DTC]].

## ACATS’ ADVANCED CLIENT INTERFACES

The new advanced client interfaces allow firms to process account transfers. The transition to new communication protocols adds flexibility and speed to market for business expansion, marking the beginning of an incremental approach to the modernization of this critical industry service. The new client interfaces use standard JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) message formats that replace current fixed and variable formats.

Novation refers to the process of substituting the original contract with a replacement contract, where the original party agrees to forgo any rights afforded to them by the original contract. In most novation agreements, the parties agree to extinguish the original contract and replace it with an entirely new contract.

_**this proposal is aiming to accomplish one broad goal: ensure that the [[NSCC]] can oversee and clear [[SFT]] trading through a centralized framework that would limit market disruptions caused by decentralized risks (aka bad shorts). The NSCC has identified issues with current market structure that could result in fire sales, in which [[Liquidation]] of a defaulting member would cause other non-defaulting members to liquidate similar positions without due cause. More importantly, the NSCC has identified potential issues with [[Securities Lenders]] reinvesting cash [[Collateral]] which significantly raises the likelihood of a lender defaulting. If a lender were to [[Default]] on a large [[short position]], this could result in massive selling of shorted [[securities]] and further exacerbate [[Liquidity]] and [[FTD]] issues. While this proposal may limit some aspects of a short squeeze, it also helps protect against downward price pressure caused by irresponsible [[Short Selling]] and would likely severely decrease the amount of FTDs observed in the market.**_
