The purpose of the Overview is to help depository institutions comply with the Federal Reserve's Policy Statement on Payment System Risk (PSR policy). Depository institutions that use only minimal amounts of Federal Reserve intraday credit should use the Overview to help determine the requirements for compliance with the PSR policy. Institutions that use Federal Reserve intraday credit more regularly and those that may be considered "special situations" because of their legal structure or payment activity should obtain a copy of the _Guide to the Federal Reserve's Payment System Risk Policy_ for a more comprehensive description of the PSR policy's requirements.

The _Guide to the Federal Reserve's Payment System Risk Policy_ (the _Guide_) contains detailed information on the steps necessary to comply with the Federal Reserve's intraday credit policies. Any institution using Federal Reserve intraday credit, regardless of the amount, should have the capability to monitor its Federal Reserve account balance on an intraday basis and should understand the risks inherent in the provision of payment services generally.
