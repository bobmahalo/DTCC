Payment for order flow ([[PFOF]]) is the practice of wholesale [[Market Maker]]s paying [[Broker]]s (typically retail brokers) for their clients’ order flow. By acquiring order flow in this way, market makers are able to trade profitably against client orders (on average) while clients may benefit from reduced trading costs because the commissions retail brokers charge may be subsidized by the payments they receive from wholesale market makers.
Critics of PFOF argue that this arrangement creates a conflict of interest in brokers’ best execution obligations to their clients. Specifically, brokers may be incentivized to route customer orders to the highest bidder rather than to the market maker or trading venue offering the best prices and fastest execution. Clients in the United Kingdom face another potential disadvantage because market makers engaging in PFOF could seek to recover these payments by increasing the spreads they offer.
