When you buy a security, whether through your [[Broker]]-dealer or from the [[Issuer]] itself, you might have the option to have the actual physical stock or bond certificate sent to you. The security is registered in your name on the issuer's books, and you receive a paper certificate representing your ownership of the security. With this option, you might be assessed a fee for the added expense of issuing a paper certificate. It is important to safeguard physical certificates until you sell or transfer your [[Securities]]; if your physical certificates are lost, stolen, or destroyed, you might experience difficulties in selling or otherwise transferring your securities and, if you seek to replace them, you typically will need to undertake administrative steps required by the issuer or its [[Transfer Agent]] and will incur associated expenses. Your broker-dealer — or the issuer or its transfer agent — will generally charge a fee to replace a lost or stolen stock certificate. For more information on safeguarding your securities, please read the SEC’s “Fast Answer” on [Lost or Stolen Stock Certificates](https://www.sec.gov/answers/lostcert.htm).
