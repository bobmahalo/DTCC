Let's discuss the two key components that make up an [[option]]s price: [[intrinsic value]] and [[time value]]. The premium, often referred to as time value, is a crucial factor in determining the overall price of an [[Option]]. For instance, in an [[in the money]] [[Call option]] with a [[strike]] of 65 and an [[underlying]] security of 67, the [[option]] price would be 3, comprising of 2 points of [[intrinsic value]] and 1 point of [[Premium]]. On the other hand, an [[out of the money]] [[Call option]] with a [[strike]] of 65 and [[underlying]] security at 63 would have an [[Option]] price of 1-1/2, with the entire amount being attributed to the [[Premium]] as there is no [[intrinsic value]]. This understanding of the components of an options price is essential in making informed investment decisions.
