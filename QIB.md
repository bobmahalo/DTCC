Qualified Institutional Buyers. The [[SEC]] today proposes a definition for the term "qualified purchaser" under the [[Securities Act of 1933]] to implement a provision of the [[National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996]]. The proposed definition mirrors the definition of [[Accredited Investors]] under [[Regulation D]] of the Securities Act. Thus, the new qualified purchaser definition identifies well-established categories of persons we have previously - to be financially sophisticated and therefore not in need of the protection of state registration when they are offered or sold [[Securities]]. This proposal should facilitate [[Capital Formation]], especially for small businesses. It will implement the Congressional intent, impose uniformity in the regulation of transactions to these financially sophisticated persons and reduce burdens on capital formation.
