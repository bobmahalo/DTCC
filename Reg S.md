The [[SEC]] adopted Regulation S in 1990 as a safe harbor from the registration requirements of the [[Securities Act of 1933]] for offshore offers and sales of [[Securities]]. Although the regulation has proved successful for many types of offerings, abuses in connection with sales of domestic equity securities have been common. Regulation S has been used as a means of perpetrating fraudulent and manipulative schemes, especially schemes involving the securities of thinly capitalized or "microcap" companies. These types of securities are particularly vulnerable to fraud and manipulation because little information about them is available to investors.

2. Either of the following:
    - The buyer is outside of the United States or
    - The offeror, reasonably in good faith, believes that the buyer is outside of the United States or
    - The transaction is executed on an established foreign securities exchange.

This means that the buyer should be physically located outside the United States at the time of the offer and the sale.
