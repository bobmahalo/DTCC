Regulation D is a Securities and Exchange Commission ([[SEC]]) regulation which oversees certain types of [private placements](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/private_placement). 

Generally, any [security](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities)[offering](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/offering) must comply with the [Section 5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/section_5) of [Securities Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_act_of_1933), which requires the [[Issuer]] to file a [registration statement](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/registration_statement). [Section 4(a)(2)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77d), however, exempts “transactions by an issuer not involving any [[public offering]],” i.e. a private placement, from the requirement to file a registration statement. Currently, Regulation D, [17 C.F.R. § 230.501 et seq.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.501), governs how companies can conduct private placements of securities. Under [Rule 504](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rule_504) companies may privately place up to $5,000,000 with minimal restrictions. Under [Rule 506](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rule_506) there is no cap on the offering value, but issuers must meet a handful of other restrictions.
