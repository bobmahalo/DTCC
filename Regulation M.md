The [[SEC]]'s Regulation M is designed to prevent manipulation by individuals with an interest in the outcome of an offering, and prohibits activities and conduct that could artificially influence the market for an offered security.

As part of its program to monitor firms for compliance with Regulation M, [[FINRA]]'s Market Regulation Department reviews over-the-counter trading([[OTC]]) and quoting activity for prohibited purchases, bids or attempts to induce bids or purchases during the applicable restricted period, and for prohibited [[short sale]]s during the five-day period prior to pricing the offering. Per FINRA rules, firms must provide FINRA with pertinent distribution-related information in a timely fashion to facilitate this component of its Regulation M compliance program.

Firms are reminded that in addition to the Regulation M-related reporting requirements under FINRA rules, discussed in detail inÂ [Regulatory Notice 08-74](https://www.finra.org/node/7419), they may have other reporting obligations, e.g., under the FINRA transaction reporting rules or the Regulation M-related rules of a national [[Stock Exchange]].
