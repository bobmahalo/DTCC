[[Rehypothecation]] is an alternative name for [[Repledging]]. In the [[Derivatives]] market, rehypothecation is sometimes called _re-use_. However, the term ‘re-use’ is also applied in the repo market for the onward outright sale of [[Collateral]] by a repo buyer to a third party in the cash market. This has caused some confusion.
