**SUMMARY:** The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting two rules to improve public disclosure of order execution and routing practices. Under Rule 11Ac1-5, market centers that trade [[National Market System]] [[Securities]] will be required to make available to the public monthly electronic reports that include uniform statistical measures of execution quality. Under [[Rule 11Ac1-6]], [[Broker]]-dealers that route customer orders in equity and option [[Securities]] will be required to make publicly available quarterly reports that, among other things, identify the venues to which customer orders are routed for execution. In addition, broker-dealers will be required to disclose to customers, on request, the venues to which their individual orders were routed. By making visible the execution quality of the securities markets, the rules are intended to spur more vigorous competition among market participants to provide the best possible prices for investor orders.

**EFFECTIVE DATE:** January 30, 2001. For specific phase-in dates for compliance with the rules, see section V of this release. In addition, the national securities exchanges and the national securities association subject to §240.11Ac1-5(b)(2) shall comply with that provision by submitting a [[National Market System]] plan to The Securities and Exchange Commission by no later than February 15, 2001.
