Under Rule 11Ac1-6 as adopted, a [[Broker]]-dealer that routes orders on behalf of customers will be required to prepare quarterly reports that disclose the identity of the venues to which it routed orders for execution. The reports also will disclose the nature of the broker-dealer's relationship with those venues, including the existence of any internalization or [[Payment For Order Flow]] arrangements. Finally, broker-dealers will be required to disclose, on customer request, where they routed a customer's individual orders for execution.

In a significant change from the rule as proposed, a broker-dealer will not be required to prepare a narrative section for the reports that discusses and analyzes its order routing practices. The Commission agrees with commenters that such a requirement could result in reports that were overly long and complex. In addition, a broker-dealer will not be required to identify every venue to which it routed any orders. Instead, only the most significant venues - the top ten and any others that received 5% or more of the broker-dealer's orders - must be disclosed. The primary purpose of the Rule as adopted is simply to assure public disclosure of the significant venues to which a broker-dealer routes its customer's orders and to facilitate an evaluation of potential conflicts of interest between the broker-dealer and its customers. When combined with the information to be made available by market centers under Rule 11Ac1-5, the quarterly reports should provide a much clearer picture of a broker-dealer's order routing practices than has previously been available to the public.
