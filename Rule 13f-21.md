Rule 13f-2 will require an Institutional Investment Manager to file, within 14 calendar days after the end of each calendar month, a [[Form SHO]] report via the Commission’s([[SEC]]) Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system ([[EDGAR]]) for
    - each equity security that is of a class of [[Securities]] registered pursuant to Section 12 of the [[The Exchange Act]] or for which the [[Issuer]] is required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (Reporting Company Issuer) over which the Institutional Investment Manager and all accounts over which it has investment discretion with respect to either (i) a monthly average gross short position at the close of regular trading hours in the equity security with a value of USD $10 million or more or (ii) a monthly average gross short position at the close of regular trading hours as a percentage of the [[Issuer]]’s total shares outstanding of 2.5% or more
    - each equity security that is of a class of securities of an issuer that is not a Reporting Company Issuer over which the Institutional Investment Manager and all accounts over which it has investment discretion with respect to a gross short position with a U.S. dollar value of $500,000 or more at the close of regular trading on any settlement date during the calendar month (notably, and different from the calculation for Reporting Company Issuers, such calculation is **_not_** determined based on the monthly average gross short position but rather will be triggered if exceeded on any settlement date during the reporting month)
- Institutional Investment Managers, with respect to [[short position]]s in reported equity securities meeting the above-described thresholds, will be required to report on Form SHO information concerning the end-of-month gross short position, as well as detailed information on the Institutional Investment Manager’s daily “net” activity, in each reported equity security.
- The SEC expects that it will make public aggregated information derived from data reported on Form SHO within one month after the end of the reporting calendar month.
