 Rule 144 allows public resale of [[Restricted Securities]] and control securities if a number of conditions are met. This overview tells you what you need to know about selling your restricted or control securities. It also describes how to have a restrictive legend removed.

If you want to sell your restricted or control securities to the public, you can meet the applicable conditions set forth in Rule 144. The rule is not the exclusive means for selling restricted or control securities, but provides a "safe harbor" exemption to sellers. The rule's five conditions are summarized below:

Additional [[Securities]] purchased from the [[issuer]] do not affect the holding period of previously purchased securities of the same class. If you purchased [[Restricted Securities]] from another non-affiliate, you can tack on that non-affiliate's holding period to your holding period. For gifts made by an affiliate, the holding period begins when the affiliate acquired the securities and not on the date of the gift. In the case of a stock option, including employee stock options, the holding period begins on the date the option is exercised and not the date it is granted.

1. **Holding Period**. Before you may sell any restricted securities in the marketplace, you must hold them for a certain period of time. If the company that issued the securities is a “reporting company” in that it is subject to the reporting requirements of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]], then you must hold the securities for at least six months. If the issuer of the securities is not subject to the reporting requirements, then you must hold the securities for at least one year. The relevant holding period begins when the securities were bought and fully paid for. The holding period only applies to restricted securities. Because securities acquired in the public market are not restricted, there is no holding period for an affiliate who purchases securities of the issuer in the marketplace. But the resale of an affiliate's [[shares]] as control securities is subject to the other conditions of the rule.
2. **Current Public Information**.  There must be adequate current information about the issuing company publicly available before the sale can be made. For reporting companies, this generally means that the companies have complied with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For non-reporting companies, this means that certain company information, including information regarding the nature of its business, the identity of its officers and directors, and its financial statements, is publicly available.
3. **Trading Volume Formula**. If you are an affiliate, the number of equity securities you may sell during any three-month period cannot exceed the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold, or if the class is listed on a [[Stock Exchange]], the greater of 1% or the average reported weekly trading volume during the four weeks preceding the filing of a notice of sale on Form 144.  Over-the-counter ([[OTC]]) [[Stock]]s, including those quoted on the [OTC Bulletin Board](https://www.sec.gov/answers/otcbb.htm) and the [Pink Sheets](https://www.sec.gov/answers/pink.htm), can only be sold using the 1% measurement.
4. **Ordinary Brokerage Transactions**.  If you are an affiliate, the sales must be handled in all respects as routine trading transactions, and brokers may not receive more than a normal commission.  Neither the seller nor the broker can solicit orders to buy the securities.
5. **Filing a Notice of Proposed Sale With the [[SEC]]**.  If you are an affiliate, you must file a notice with the SEC on [Form 144](https://www.sec.gov/answers/form144.htm) if the sale involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period.
