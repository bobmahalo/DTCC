Rule 144A (formally [17 CFR § 230.144A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.144A)) is a Securities Exchange Commission [[SEC]] regulation that enables purchasers of [securities](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities) in a [private placement](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/private_placement) to resell their securities to [qualified institutional buyers (QIBs)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_institutional_buyer_%28qib%29) under certain conditions. 

Generally, under [[Rule 506]] of [[Regulation D]], purchasers of securities issued in a private placement may not resell their [[Securities]]. Rule 144A allows purchasers of such securities to resell those securities if: (1) the sale is to a qualified institutional buyer ([[QIB]]); (2) the seller takes affirmative steps to ensure that the buyer is aware that the seller relies on Rule 144A to sell their security; (3) the securities are not of the same class as securities traded on a national securities exchange; and (4) the purchaser has the right to request information from the original issuer of the security. 

Rule 144A makes issuing large quantities of securities in private placements under [[Rule 506]] more attractive because it increases the [[Liquidity]] of those securities sold in a private placement. That is, since the institutional [[Investor]]s who initially purchased the issuer’s securities in a private placement can sell to a broader group of prospective secondary purchasers under Rule 144A, it makes private placements more attractive.
