[[The Exchange Act]] Rule 15c3-3 (Customer Protection Rule) imposes requirements on member firms that are designed to protect customer funds and [[Securities]]. Member firms are obligated to maintain [[Custody]] of customers’ fully paid and excess [[Margin]] securities, safeguard customer cash by segregating these assets from the firm’s proprietary business activities and promptly delivering them to their owner upon request. Member firms can satisfy these requirements by keeping customer funds in a special reserve bank account and by maintaining customer securities in their physical possession or in a good control location that allows the firm to direct their movements. Member firms are required to maintain a reserve of cash or qualified securities in the special reserve bank account that is at least equal in value to the net cash owed to customers, including cash obtained from the use of customer securities. The amount of net cash owed to customers is computed pursuant to the formula set forth in Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3.
