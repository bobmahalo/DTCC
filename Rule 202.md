As proposed, rule 202(a)(11)(G)-1 contains three general conditions. First, the

exclusion is limited to [[Family Office]]s that provide advice about [[securities]] only to certain

“family clients.” Second, it requires that family clients wholly own the family office and

family members and/or family entities control the family office. Third, it precludes a

family office from holding itself out to the public as an investment adviser . In addition to

these conditions, we have incorporated into the rule the “grandfathering” provision

required by section 409 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
