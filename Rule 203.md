Rule 203(b)(1) of [[Reg SHO]] requires that, prior to accepting a [[Short Sale]] order or effecting a short sale order in an equity security for the [[Broker]]-dealer’s own account, a broker or dealer must borrow the security, enter into a bona fide arrangement to borrow the security or have reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on settlement date (_i.e._, receives a “[[Locate]]”). Pursuant to [[SEC]] guidance, if a broker-dealer receives a locate for a short sale order that is executed and subsequently covered on the same day, the broker-dealer may [[reuse]] that locate for a subsequent short sale order, provided that the subsequent short sale order is for a quantity no greater than the quantity of the original locate, and the original locate was deemed by its source to be good for the entire trading day. For a "hard to borrow" security or [[Threshold Securities]], however, a broker-dealer may not re-apply a locate for intraday buy to cover trades. SEC guidance has explained that, without obtaining locates prior to each short sale in hard to borrow or threshold securities, it is unlikely that a broker-dealer executing short sales in such securities would have reasonable grounds to believe that the securities can be borrowed so that they can be delivered on the date that delivery is due on each trade.
