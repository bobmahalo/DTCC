Pursuant to [[SEC]] guidance, a member firm may use exchange-traded funds ([[ETF]]) conversion activity to meet the purchase requirement of the rule under certain circumstances as detailed in a**Â [**2017 SEC No-Action Letter**](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mr-noaction/2017/murphy-mcgonigle-042617-204-sho.pdf)**.
