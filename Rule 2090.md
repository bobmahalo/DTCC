**.01 Essential Facts.** For purposes of this Rule, facts "essential" to "knowing the customer" are those required to (a) effectively service the customer's account, (b) act in accordance with any special handling instructions for the account, (c) understand the authority of each person acting on behalf of the customer, and (d) comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

In general, new [[FINRA]] Rule 2090 (Know Your Customer) is modeled after former [[NYSE]]

[[Rule 405]](1) and requires firms to use “reasonable diligence,” in regard to the opening and

maintenance of every account, to know the “essential facts” concerning every customer.

The rule explains that “essential facts” are “those required to (a) effectively service the

customer’s account, (b) act in accordance with any special handling instructions for the

account, (c) understand the authority of each person acting on behalf of the customer,

and (d) comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.” The know-your-customer

obligation arises at the beginning of the customer-[[Broker]] relationship and does not depend

on whether the broker has made a recommendation. Unlike former NYSE Rule 405, the new

rule does not specifically address orders, supervision or account opening—areas that are

explicitly covered by other rules.
