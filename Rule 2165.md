[[FINRA]] Rule 2165 (Financial Exploitation of Specified Adults) is the first uniform national standard for placing temporary holds to address suspected financial exploitation. Rule 2165 permits a member to place a temporary hold on a [[Securities]] transaction or disbursement of funds or securities from the account of a Specified Adult customer when the firm reasonably believes that financial exploitation of that adult has occurred, is occurring, has been attempted or will be attempted. FINRA [[Rule 4512]] (Customer Account Information) requires members to make reasonable efforts to obtain the name of and contact information for a trusted contact person (“trusted contact”) for a customer’s account.

On June 9, 2021, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“[[FINRA]]”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“[[SEC]]” or “Commission”) the proposed rule change SR-FINRA-2021-016 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] (“Exchange Act”)  and Rule 19b-4 thereunder  to amend FINRA Rule 2165 (Financial Exploitation of Specified Adults) to: (1) Permit member firms to place a temporary hold on a [[Securities]] transaction, subject to the same terms and restrictions applicable to a temporary hold on disbursements of funds or securities (“disbursements”), where there is a reasonable belief of financial exploitation of a “specified adult” as defined in the rule;  (2) permit member firms to extend a temporary hold, whether on a disbursement or a transaction, for an additional 30 business days if the member firm has reported the matter to a state regulator or agency or a court of competent jurisdiction; and (3) require member firms to retain records of the reason and support for any extension of any temporary hold, including information regarding any communications with, or by, a state regulator or agency of competent jurisdiction or a court of competent jurisdiction. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the **Federal Register** on June 28, 2021. On July 20, 2021, FINRA consented to extend until September 24, 2021, the time period in which the Commission must approve the proposed rule change, disapprove the proposed rule change, or institute proceedings to determine whether to approve or disapprove the proposed rule change. On August 23, 2021, FINRA responded to the comment letters received in response to the Notice.
