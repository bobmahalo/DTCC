[[FINRA]] Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public) categorizes all communications into three categories—correspondence, retail communications or institutional communications—and sets principles-based content standards that are designed to apply to ongoing developments in communications technology and practices. The rule also includes standards for firms’ approval, review and recordkeeping procedures, as well as requirements to file certain communications with [[FINRA]]. FINRA Rule 2210 requires, among other things, that all communications be based on principles of fair dealing and good faith, be fair and balanced, provide a sound basis for evaluating the facts “in regard to any particular security or type of security, industry, or service” and include all “material fact[s] or qualification[s]” necessary to ensure such communications are not misleading. In addition, the rule prohibits false, misleading, promissory or exaggerated statements or claims, and projections of performance.
