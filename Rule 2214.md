# Requirements for the Use of Investment Analysis Tools

**(a) General Considerations**

This Rule provides a limited exception toÂ [[Rule 2210]](d)(1)(F). No member may imply that [[FINRA]] endorses or approves the use of any investment analysis tool or any recommendation based on such a tool. A member that offers or intends to offer an investment analysis tool under this Rule (whether customers use the member's tool independently or with assistance from the member) must provide FINRA's Advertising Regulation Department ("Department") access to the investment analysis tool upon request.

**(b) Definition**

For purposes of this Rule and any interpretation thereof, an "investment analysis tool" is an interactive technological tool that produces simulations and statistical analyses that present the likelihood of various investment outcomes if certain investments are made or certain investment strategies or styles are undertaken, thereby serving as an additional resource to investors in the evaluation of the potential risks and returns of investment choices.

**(c) Use of Investment Analysis Tools and Related Written Reports and Retail Communications**

A member may provide an investment analysis tool (whether customers use the member's tool independently or with assistance from the member), written reports indicating the results generated by such tool and related retail communications only if the tool, written report or related retail communication:

(1) describes the criteria and methodology used, including the investment analysis tool's limitations and key assumptions;

(2) explains that results may vary with each use and over time;

(3) if applicable, describes the universe of investments considered in the analysis, explains how the tool determines which [[Securities]] to select, discloses if the tool favors certain securities and, if so, explains the reason for the selectivity, and states that other investments not considered may have characteristics similar or superior to those being analyzed; and

(4) displays the following additional disclosure: "IMPORTANT: The projections or other information generated by name of investment analysis tool regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results and are not guarantees of future results."

**(d) Disclosures**

The disclosures and other required information discussed in paragraph (c) must be clear and prominent and must be in written (which may be electronic) narrative form.
