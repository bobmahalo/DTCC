Rule 415 of the [[Securities Act of 1933]], however, provides, “[[Securities]] may be registered for an offering to be made on a continuous or delayed basis in the future.” That is, Rule 415 creates a carve-out from Section 5’s requirement that [[Issuer]]s must file a registration statement to offer securities by allowing issuers to offer securities continuously in the future based on a single prospectus. Only seasoned issuers and well-known seasoned issuers are eligible for shelf registrations. Most [[shelf offering]]s are done with [[SEC]] [[Form S-3]]. 

The primary advantages of shelf offerings are timing and certainty. Issuers can issue their securities when market conditions are optimal, and do not have to wait for extensive SEC review after they file their core prospectus. The core prospectus also prospectively incorporates by reference the issuer’s periodic reports, meaning the issuer does not need to amend the core prospectus in the event of material developments. Section 11 still applies to subsequent issues in a shelf offering though, so the issuer must be sure that any material developments are included in disclosures incorporated by reference or file a supplemental prospectus.
