# Carrying Agreements

(a)(1) Unless otherwise permitted by [[FINRA]], a [[Member]] shall not enter into an agreement for the carrying, on an omnibus or fully disclosed basis, of any customer account in which [[Securities]] transactions can be effected ("customer account" or "account"), unless such agreement is with a carrying firm that is a FINRA member. An introducing firm that acts as an [[intermediary]] for another introducing firm(s) for the purpose of obtaining clearing services from the carrying firm must notify such carrying firm of the existence of such arrangement(s) and the identity of the other introducing firm(s). Each such carrying agreement(s) shall identify and bind every direct and indirect recipient of clearing services as a party thereto.

(2) A carrying firm may enter into a carrying agreement(s) for the carrying of the customer accounts of a person other than a U.S. registered [[Broker]] or dealer, subject to the conditions set forth in this Rule.Â 

(b)(1) The carrying firm shall submit to [[FINRA]] for prior approval any agreement for the carrying of accounts, whether on an omnibus or fully disclosed basis, before such agreement may become effective. The carrying firm also shall submit to FINRA for prior approval any material changes to an approved carrying agreement before such changes may become effective.

(2) A carrying firm may use a standardized form of agreement that has been approved by FINRA pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this Rule, to enter into new carrying arrangements with other U.S. registered brokers or dealers, without the resubmission and re-approval of such agreement. However, a carrying firm must submit to FINRA for approval each carrying agreement that includes a party that is not a U. S. registered broker or dealer.

(3) As early as possible, but not later than 10 business days, prior to the carrying of any accounts of a new introducing firm (including the accounts of any introducing firm(s) for which a new or existing introducing firm is acting as an intermediary in obtaining clearing services from the carrying firm) the carrying firm shall submit to FINRA a notice identifying each such introducing firm by name and CRD number and shall include such additional information as FINRA may require.

(4) Each carrying firm shall conduct appropriate due diligence with respect to any new introducing firm relationship to assess the financial, operational, credit and reputational risk that such arrangement will have upon the carrying firm. FINRA, in its review of any arrangement, may in its discretion require specific items to be addressed by the carrying firm as part of such firm's due diligence requirement under this Rule. The carrying firm shall maintain a record, in accordance with the timeframes prescribed by SEA Rule 17a-4(b), of the due diligence conducted for each new introducing firm.

(c)(1) Each carrying agreement in which accounts are to be carried on a fully disclosed basis shall specify the responsibilities of each party to the agreement, including at a minimum the allocation of the responsibilities set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(A) through (I) and (c)(2) of this Rule. The allocation of such responsibilities shall be subject to approval by FINRA pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this Rule.

(A) Opening and approving accounts.

(B) Acceptance of orders.

(C) Transmission of orders for execution.

(D) Execution of orders.

(E) Extension of credit.

(F) Receipt and delivery of funds and securities.

(G) Preparation and transmission of confirmations.

(H) Maintenance of books and records.

(I) Monitoring of accounts.

(2) Each carrying agreement in which accounts are to be carried on a fully disclosed basis shall expressly allocate to the carrying firm the responsibility for the safeguarding of funds and securities for the purposes of SEA [[Rule 15c3-3]] and for preparing and transmitting statements of account to customers. However, the carrying firm may authorize the introducing firm to prepare and/or transmit statements of account to customers on the carrying firm's behalf with the prior written approval of FINRA.

(d) Each customer whose account is introduced on a fully disclosed basis shall be notified in writing upon the opening of the account of the existence of the carrying agreement and the responsibilities allocated to each respective party. The carrying firm shall be responsible for the content of such notification to the customer. The customer shall be notified promptly and in writing in the event of any change to any of the parties to the agreement or any material change to the allocation of responsibilities thereunder.

(e) Each carrying agreement shall expressly state that to the extent that a particular responsibility is allocated to one party, the other party or parties will supply to the responsible organization all appropriate data in their possession pertinent to the proper performance and supervision of that responsibility.

(f) A carrying agreement may authorize an introducing firm to issue negotiable instruments directly to its customers on the carrying firm's behalf, using instruments for which the carrying firm is the maker or drawer, provided that the parties comply with SEA [[Rule 15c3-3]] and further that the introducing firm represents to the carrying firm in writing that such introducing firm maintains, and will enforce, supervisory policies and procedures with respect to the issuance of such negotiable instruments that are satisfactory to the carrying firm.

(g)(1) Each carrying agreement shall expressly authorize and direct the carrying firm to:

(A) furnish promptly to the introducing firm and the introducing firm's designated examining authority (or, if none, to its appropriate regulatory agency or authority) any written customer complaint received regarding the conduct of the introducing firm or firms and its associated persons; and

(B) notify the complaining customer, in writing, that it has received the complaint and that such complaint has been furnished to the introducing firm and its designated examining authority (or, if none, to its appropriate regulatory agency or authority).

(2) Upon a showing of good cause, FINRA, at its discretion, may exclude certain carrying firms from the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) in instances where the introducing firm is an affiliated entity of the carrying firm.

(h)(1) At the commencement of the agreement and annually thereafter, the carrying firm must furnish to each of its introducing firms a list of all reports (e.g., exception reports) available to assist the introducing firm with the responsibilities allocated to it pursuant to the carrying agreement. The introducing firm must promptly request of the carrying firm, in writing, those offered reports that it requires.

(2) No later than July 1 of each year, the carrying firm shall notify the introducing firm's chief executive and chief compliance officer(s) in writing of the list of reports offered to, requested by and supplied to the introducing firm as of the date of the notice. A copy of this written notice must at the same time be provided to the introducing firm's designated examining authority (or if none, to its appropriate regulatory agency or authority).

(3) The carrying firm shall maintain as part of its books and records those reports requested by and supplied to the introducing firm. The carrying firm may satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by furnishing, upon request of the introducing firm's designated examining authority (or if none, to its appropriate regulatory agency or authority):

(A) a re-created copy of the report originally produced; or

(B) the format of the report and the applicable data elements contained in the original report.

(4) Upon a showing of good cause, FINRA, at its discretion, may exclude certain carrying firms from the requirements of this paragraph (h) in instances where the introducing firm is an affiliated entity of the carrying firm.

(i) All carrying agreements shall require each introducing firm to maintain its proprietary and customer accounts, and the proprietary and customer accounts of any introducing firm for which it is acting as an intermediary in obtaining clearing services from the carrying firm, in such a manner as to enable the carrying firm and FINRA to specifically identify the proprietary and customer accounts belonging to each introducing firm. The requirements of this paragraph (i) shall apply to intermediary clearing arrangements that are established on or after February 20, 2006.
