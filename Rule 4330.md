**(a) Authorization to Lend Customers' [[Margin]] [[Securities]]**

No member shall lend [[Securities]] that are held on [[Margin]] for a customer and that are eligible to be pledged or loaned, unless such member shall first have obtained a written authorization from such customer permitting the lending of such securities.

(B) comply with the requirements of Section 15(e) of [[The Exchange Act]]; and

(C) notify [[FINRA]], in such manner and format as FINRA may require, at least 30 days prior to first engaging in such [[Securities]] borrows.

(2) Prior to first entering into securities borrows with a customer pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this Rule, a member shall:

In making this determination, the member shall exercise reasonable diligence to ascertain the essential facts relative to the customer, including, but not limited to, the customer's financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment time horizon, [[Liquidity]] needs, risk tolerance and any other information the customer may disclose to the member or associated person in connection with entering such securities loans.

(B) provide the customer, in writing (which may be electronic), with the following:

(i) clear and prominent notice stating that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act([[SIPA]]) of 1970 may not protect the customer with respect to the customer's securities loan transaction and that the collateral delivered to the customer may constitute the only source of satisfaction of the member's obligation in the event the member fails to return the securities; and

(ii) disclosures regarding the customer's rights with respect to the loaned securities, and the risks and financial impact associated with the customer's loan(s) of securities, including, but not limited to:

a. loss of [[voting rights]];

b. the customer's right to sell the loaned securities and any limitations on the customer's ability to do so, if applicable;

c. the factors that determine the amount of compensation received by the member and its associated persons in connection with the use of the securities borrowed from the customer;

e. the risks associated with each type of [[Collateral]] provided to the customer;

f. that the securities may be “[[Hard-to-Borrow]]” because of [[Short Selling]] or may be used to satisfy delivery requirements resulting from [[Short Sale]]s;

g. potential tax implications, including payments deemed [[Cash-in-Lieu]] of [[Dividend]] paid on securities while on loan; and

h. the member's right to [[Liquidate]] the transaction because of a condition of the kind specified in [[Rule 4314]](b).
