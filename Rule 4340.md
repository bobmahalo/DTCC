# Callable Securities

**(a) Allocation Procedures and Customer Notice**

Each member that has in its possession or under its control any security which, by its terms, may be called or redeemed prior to maturity, shall:

(1) establish and make available on the member's website procedures by which it will allocate among its customers, on a fair and impartial basis, the [[Securities]] to be redeemed or selected as called in the event of a partial redemption or call; and

(2) provide written notice (which may be electronic) to new customers at the opening of an account, and all customers at least once every calendar year, of the manner in which they may access the allocation procedures on the member's website and that, upon a customer's request, the member will provide hard copies of the allocation procedures to the customer.

**(b) Favorable Redemptions**

Where redemption of callable [[Securities]] is made on terms that are favorable to the called parties, a member shall not allocate the securities to any account in which it or its associated persons have an interest until all other customers' positions in such securities have been satisfied.

**(c) Unfavorable Redemptions**

Where the redemption of callable securities is made on terms that are unfavorable to the called parties, a member shall not exclude its positions or those of its associated persons (including those persons performing solely clerical and ministerial functions) from the pool of the securities eligible to be called.

**• • • _Supplementary Material:_ --------------**

**.01 Definition of Associated Person; Clerical and Ministerial Functions.** The term “associated person” as used in this Rule shall have the meaning provided in Section 3(a)(18) of [[The Exchange Act]], which expressly excludes, for certain purposes, any person associated with the member whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial (referred to as “clerical and ministerial associated persons”). With respect to a redemption made on terms that are favorable to the called parties, for purposes of paragraph (b) of this Rule, a member may include the accounts of clerical and ministerial associated persons in the pool of the securities eligible to be called. With respect to a redemption made on terms that are unfavorable to the called parties, for purposes of paragraph (c) of this Rule, a member shall not exclude the accounts of clerical and ministerial associated persons from the pool of the securities eligible to be called.

**.02 Allocations of Partial Redemptions or Calls.** For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this Rule, a member's procedures may include the use of an impartial lottery system, acting on a [[Pro-Rata]] basis, or such other means as will achieve a fair and impartial allocation of the partially redeemed or called securities.

**.03 Accounts of an Introducing Member and its Associated Persons.** Where an introducing member is a party to a carrying agreement with another member that is conducting an allocation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this Rule, any accounts in which the introducing [[Member]] or its associated persons have an interest shall be subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Rule. The introducing member also shall identify such accounts to the member conducting the allocation.
