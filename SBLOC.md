SBLOCs are a type of [[Securities]]-based lending offered to [[Investor]]s. Other types include stock-based loan programs.

Set up as a revolving line of credit, an SBLOC allows you to borrow money using securities held in your investment accounts as [[Collateral]]. An SBLOC requires you to make monthly, interest-only payments, and the loan remains outstanding until you repay it. You can repay some (or all) of the outstanding principal at any time, then borrow again later.

You can continue to trade in your pledged accounts; however, if the value of your securities declines to an amount where it’s no longer sufficient to support your line of credit, you’ll receive a “maintenance call” notifying you that you must post additional collateral or repay the loan within a specified period (typically two or three days). If you can’t meet the requirements, the firm can sell your securities and keep the cash to satisfy the maintenance call.

SBLOCs are non-purpose loans, which means you can’t use the proceeds to purchase or trade securities. However, an SBLOC still provides a fair amount of flexibility: Unlike some other types of loans that require loan proceeds to be used for a specific purpose, money from an SBLOC can be used to finance virtually anything—other than purchasing or trading securities.
