[SEC Rule 17Ad-10(g)](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/8000-7900.html#8000gra240.17ad-10) requires registered [[Transfer Agent]]s that have both caused a physical [[Overissuance]] of [[Securities]] and know that an [[Overissuance]] has occurred to buy-in securities equal to the number of shares in the case of securities or the principal dollar amount in the case of debt securities. The transfer agent must buy-in the securities within 60 days of the date it discovers the physical [[Overissuance]]. The transfer agent "discovers" an [[Overissuance]] when the transfer agent identifies the erroneously issued certificate(s) and the [[Registered Owner]]/securityholder(s).

Within the 60 day timeframe, the transfer agent must work diligently to resolve the [[Overissuance]] and recover the certificates involved. In the following cases, however, the transfer agent does not have to buy-in physically overissued securities:

- The transfer agent has obtained a letter from the holder of the overissued certificates in which the holder confirms that the overissued certificates will be returned to the transfer agent within 30 days. If the overissued certificates are not returned within this 30 days period the transfer agent must immediately buy in the overissued securities.
- The overissued certificates are covered by a surety bond indemnifying the transfer agent for all expenses resulting from the [[Overissuance]]. The transfer agent is required, however, to act diligently in resolving the [[Overissuance]] and recovering the overissued certificates.

**(b). Required Reports - Reports to Issuers**

A transfer agent must report to issuers buy-ins executed pursuant to [[SEC]] Rule 17Ad-10(g). Recordkeeping transfer agents must report as follows:

- The official performing corporate secretary functions for the [[Issuer]] of the securities for which the aged record difference exists;
- For municipal securities, the chief financial officer of the issuer of the securities for which the aged record difference exists;
- The named transfer agent, if the recordkeeping transfer agent acts as a service company.

Note: A recordkeeping transfer agent that transfers only its own securities does not have to report aged record differences to issuers, but does have to make the required reports to regulatory agencies.

A named transfer agent engaged by an issuer to maintain and update the master securityholder file must report buy-ins to the following:

- The official performing corporate secretary functions for the issuer of the securities for which the aged record difference exists;
- For municipal securities, the chief financial officer of the issuer of the securities for which the aged record difference exists;

Required reports must be sent within ten business days following the end of the month in which the buy-in occurred. Named transfer agents that have engaged a service company must send the report within ten days following the date on which the named transfer agent receives a report from the service company that the service company has bought in securities. SEC Rule 17Ad-10(c) requires co-transfer agents to report buy-ins to the named fiduciary within three business days following the month in which the buy-in occurred. The reports must contain the following information:

- The principal dollar amount of debt securities and the related market value or the number of shares and related market value of securities that were bought in. Note: Co-transfer agents are required to include this information in the report they are required to make to named transfer agents;
- The party that executed the buy-in; and
- The reason for the buy-in. Note: Co-transfer agents are required to include this information in the report they are required to make to named transfer agents.

**(c). Reports to Appropriate Regulatory Agencies**

Buy-ins must be reported to the appropriate regulatory agency when the aggregate market value of all buy-ins executed in a calendar quarter exceeds $100,000. The information reported is the same as that reported to issuers. Reports to the appropriate regulatory agency must be made within 10 business days following the end of the calendar quarter in which aggregate buy-ins exceeded $100,000. 

Note: The market value of an issue is determined as of the last business day on which market value information is available during the reporting period.

Reports must be retained for at least three years, the first year in an easily accessible place.
