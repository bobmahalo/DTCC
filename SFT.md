To capture maximum capital and balance sheet efficiencies, all SFTs are required to be executed as overnight term transactions. However, to minimize the operational burden of settling overnight [[obligations]], settlements are allowed to pair off daily against new activity, with [[NSCC]] calculating and processing Price Differential, that is price differences/[[Mark-to-Market]] (MTM), that are created by the daily [[pair off]]. [[NSCC]] conducts [[Novation]] and guarantees the off-leg/return of an SFT (i) when delivery of underlying SFT security completes at [[DTC]], (ii) at the point of validation in the case of a bilaterally settled SFT or an SFT with a Sponsored Member client or (iii) when the daily pair-off occurs, in the case of a rolled SFT.
