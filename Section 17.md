[Section 17(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77q) is a key anti-fraud provision in the [[Securities Act of 1933]]. It provides for liability for fraudulent sales of [[Securities]]. Some courts have found an implied right of private action under this provision, though this is becoming a less favored position. However, some courts continue to accept private suits under this provision. Section 17(a) makes it unlawful to "employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud", "obtain money or property" by using material misstatements or omissions, or to "engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser." This provision is closely tracked by [Section 10b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78j) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule [10b-5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/rule_10b-5), which is used more widely by investors suing for fraud.
