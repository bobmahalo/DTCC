**Sec. 405 . NOTIFICATIONS TO EXCHANGE**

Prompt notice from the listed company ([[Issuer]]) to the Exchange([[NYSE]]) is required in connection with certain actions or events. If a provision of the Company Guide requires a company to give notice to the Exchange pursuant to this Section 405, the company shall provide such notice via a web portal or email address specified by the Exchange on its website (and the Exchange shall promptly update and prominently display the applicable information on its website in the event that it ever changes), except in emergency situations, when notification may instead be provided by telephone and confirmed by facsimile as specified by the Exchange on its website. For purposes of this Section 405, an emergency situation includes lack of computer or internet access; a technical problem on the systems of either the listed company or the Exchange; or an incompatibility between the systems of the listed company and the Exchange. If a material event or a statement dealing with a rumor which calls for immediate release is made shortly before the opening or during market hours, notice is required to be given through the Exchange's telephone alert procedures. (See [[Sections 401]]) If a rule containing a notification requirement does not specify that such requirement must be met by complying with the notification procedures set forth in this Section 405, the company may use the methods provided by this Section 405 or any other reasonable method. Listed [[Companies]] are encouraged to contact their Exchange representative if they have any questions about the appropriate method of providing notification under applicable Exchange rules.
