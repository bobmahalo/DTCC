**Sec. 401. OUTLINE OF EXCHANGE DISCLOSURE POLICIES**

The Exchange([[NYSE]]) considers that the conduct of a fair and orderly market requires every listed company to make available to the public information necessary for informed investing and to take reasonable steps to ensure that all who invest in its [[Securities]] enjoy equal access to such information. In applying this fundamental principle, the Exchange has adopted the following eight specific policies concerning disclosure, each of which is more fully discussed (in a Question and Answer format) in [[Section 402]]: (a) _Immediate Public Disclosure of Material Information_â€”A listed company is required to make immediate public disclosure of all material information concerning its affairs, except in unusual circumstances (referred to as the Exchange's "immediate release policy"). _When such disclosure is to be made between 7:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M., Eastern_Time, it is essential that the Exchange be notified at least ten minutes prior to the announcement._

**Commentary:** Listed companies must comply with the notification procedures in Sections 401(a) and (b) with respect to all announcements relating to a [[Dividend]] or stock distribution when such disclosure is to be made between 7:00 A.M. and 4:00 P.M., Eastern Time. (Listed companies must also comply with the notification requirements of [[section 501]] with respect to all such announcements, including outside of the hours of operation of the immediate release policy.)
