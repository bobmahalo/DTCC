SEC. 2. For the reasons hereinafter enumerated, transactions in [[Securities]] as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter ([[OTC]]) markets are effected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for [[regulation]] and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto, including transactions by officers, directors, and principal security holders, to require appropriate reports, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market system for securities and a national system for the clearance and [[settlement]] of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably complete and effective, in order to protect interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to protect and make more effective the national banking system and the [[U.S. Federal Reserve System]], and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions.
