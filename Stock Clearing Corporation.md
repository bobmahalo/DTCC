In 1920, [[NYSE]] established the Stock Clearing Corporation (SCC), which acted as a counterparty to every buyer and seller. This simplified the clearing process and reduced demands on the funding markets. Firms could now pay or receive money from SCC rather than having to issue checks to all its counterparties in a transaction. In other words, the clearinghouse could net down purchases and sales conducted on the exchange among participants, greatly reducing the need for funding. Many manual processes, however, remained in the clearing system, and physical [[Securities]] still had to be moved from the sellers to buyers.
