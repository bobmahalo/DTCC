[[OTC]] Threshold data is published daily by [[FINRA]] to identify OTC equity securities with [fails to deliver](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) that are required to be closed out pursuant to Rule 203(b)(3) of [[Reg SHO]] or FINRA [[Rule 4320]]. Firms must utilize the OTC [[Threshold list]] to ensure full compliance with the rules. While threshold status is based on the aggregate fail in a specific equity security, the obligation to close-out fail to deliver positions under both rules is at the participant level.
