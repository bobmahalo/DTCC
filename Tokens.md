Let’s start by defining an [[ICO]]. ICO or an initial coin offering has become a popular way to generate capital within the [[Blockchain]] and crypto space.

A security token offering or [[STO]] also involves an investor exchanging money for coins or tokens that represent their investment–however there are more regulations in place. STOs will undergo extensive investigations into token listings, data sharing, and investor onboarding procedures. In this way, an STO is more similar to an [[IPO]].
