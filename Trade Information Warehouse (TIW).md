[[DTCC]] pioneered ground-breaking [[Derivatives]] services in 2006 when it established the Trade Information Warehouse (TIW), the industry’s first infrastructure for record retention and [[Asset]] servicing of cleared and bilateral credit derivatives. TIW’s robust infrastructure provides automated operational capabilities across three service offerings -- the Warehouse, Lifecycle Event Processing, and Central Settlement -- for approximately $10 trillion of credit derivatives worldwide.
