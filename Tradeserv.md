TradeServ is the product of our strategic technology vision to consolidate our post trade services onto one modern cloud enabled platform that will improve service delivery and the customer experience. This platform will replace DSMatch for credit confirmation and NCM for [[Novation]] consent, leveraging cloud infrastructure.

Formerly DSMatch

Since then we have provided the credit [[Derivatives]] market with trade matching, legal confirmation, [[Novation]] consent, regulatory reporting and much more. OSTTRA TradeServ is built on micro-service architecture that delivers higher levels of flexibility and customisation, with a new graphical user interface.
