Treasury stock consists of a company's own shares that it repurchases from the open [[Stock Exchange]], and the [[SEC]] governs the rules for how publicly traded companies must report these activities. The repurchase of shares can be a strategic move to return capital to shareholders, increase earnings per share, and signal management's confidence in the company's value.

Public companies execute share buybacks for a variety of strategic reasons:Â 

- **Signal confidence**: Buying back shares can signal to the market that management believes the stock is undervalued.
- **Increase EPS**: By lowering the number of [[outstanding shares]], a company can increase its EPS, a common measure of profitability.
- **Employee compensation**: Treasury stock can be held to fulfill employee stock option plans or other forms of equity-based compensation.
- **Future capital needs**: Companies may hold shares for potential acquisitions or other corporate purposes.
- **Prevent hostile takeovers**: A large buyback can make a company less susceptible to a hostile takeover by reducing the number of shares available on the market.
