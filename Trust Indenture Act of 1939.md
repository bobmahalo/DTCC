AN ACT To provide for the regulation of the sale of certain [[Securities]] in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and the regulation of the trust indentures under which the same are issued, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof, and for other purposes’’, approved May 27, 1933, as amended, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:

SEC. 302. ø77bbb¿ (a) Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the

reports of the Securities and Exchange Commission made to the

Congress pursuant to section 211 of the Securities Exchange Act of

1934 and otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is hereby declared

that the national public interest and the interest of investors in

notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certifi-

cates of interest or participation therein, which are offered to the

public, are adversely affected—

(1) when the obligor fails to provide a trustee to protect

and enforce the rights and to represent the interests of such

investors, notwithstanding the fact that (A) individual action

by such investors for the purpose of protecting and enforcing

their rights is rendered impracticable by reason of the dis-

proportionate expense of taking such action, and (B) concerted

action by such investors in their common interest through rep-

resentatives of their own selection is impeded by reason of the

wide dispersion of such investors through many States, and by

reason of the fact that information as to the names and ad-

dresses of such investors generally is not available to such in-

vestors;

(2) when the trustee does not have adequate rights and

powers, or adequate duties and responsibilities, in connection

with matters relating to the protection and enforcement of the

rights of such investors; when, notwithstanding the obstacles

to concerted action by such investors, and the general and rea-

forcement of their rights, trust indentures (A) generally pro-

vide that the trustee shall be under no duty to take any such

action, even in the event of default, unless it receives notice of

default, demand for action, and indemnity, from the holders of

substantial percentages of the securities outstanding there-

under, and (B) generally relieve the trustee from liability even

for its own negligent action or failure to act;

(3) when the trustee does not have resources commensu-

rate with its responsibilities, or has any relationship to or con-

nection with the obligor or any underwriter of any securities

of the obligor, or holds, beneficially or otherwise, any interest

in the obligor, or any such underwriter, which relationship,

connection, or interest involves a material conflict with the in-

terests of such investors;

(4) when the obligor is not obligated to furnish to the

trustee under the indenture and to such investors adequate

current information as to its financial condition, and as to the

performance of its obligations with respect to the securities

outstanding under such indenture; or when the communication

of such information to such investors is impeded by the fact

that information as to the names and addresses of such inves-

tors generally is not available to the trustee and to such inves-

tors;

(5) when the indenture contains provisions which are mis-

leading or deceptive, or when full and fair disclosure is not

made to prospective investors of the effect of important inden-

ture provisions; or

(6) when, by reason of the fact that trust indentures are

commonly prepared by the obligor or underwriter in advance

of the public offering of the securities to be issued thereunder,

such investors are unable to participate in the preparation

thereof, and, by reason of their lack of understanding of the

situation, such investors would in any event be unable to pro-

cure the correction of the defects enumerated in this sub-

section.

(b) Practices of the character above enumerated have existed

to such an extent that, unless regulated, the public offering of

notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certifi-

cates of interest or participation therein, by the use of means that

instruments of transportation and communication in interstate

commerce and of the mails, is injurious to the capital markets, to

investors, and to the general public; and it is hereby declared to be

the policy of this title, in accordance with which policy all the pro-

visions of this title shall be interpreted, to meet the problems and

eliminate the practices, enumerated in this section, connected with

such public offerings.
