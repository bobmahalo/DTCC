AN ACT To provide for the regulation of the sale of certain [[Securities]] in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and the regulation of the trust indentures under which the same are issued, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails, and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof, and for other purposes’’, approved May 27, 1933, as amended, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:

SEC. 302. 77bbb (a) Upon the basis of facts disclosed by the reports of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]([[SEC]]) made to the Congress pursuant to section 211 of the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] and otherwise disclosed and ascertained, it is hereby declared that the national public interest and the interest of [[Investor]]s in notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certificates of interest or participation therein, which are offered to the public, are adversely affected—

(1) when the obligor fails to provide a trustee to protect and enforce the rights and to represent the interests of such [[Investor]]s, notwithstanding the fact that (A) individual action by such [[Investor]]s for the purpose of protecting and enforcing their rights is rendered impracticable by reason of the disproportionate expense of taking such action, and (B) concerted action by such [[Investor]]s in their common interest through representatives of their own selection is impeded by reason of the wide dispersion of such [[Investor]]s through many States, and by reason of the fact that information as to the names and addresses of such [[Investor]]s generally is not available to such [[Investor]]s;

(2) when the trustee does not have adequate rights and powers, or adequate duties and responsibilities, in connection with matters relating to the protection and enforcement of the rights of such [[Investor]]s; when, notwithstanding the obstacles to concerted action by such [[Investor]]s, and the general and reasonable assumption by such [[Investor]]s that the trustee is under an affirmative duty to take action for the protection and enforcement of their rights, trust indentures (A) generally provide that the trustee shall be under no duty to take any such action, even in the event of default, unless it receives notice of default, demand for action, and indemnity, from the holders of substantial percentages of the [[Securities]] outstanding thereunder, and (B) generally relieve the trustee from liability even for its own negligent action or failure to act;

(3) when the trustee does not have resources commensurate with its responsibilities, or has any relationship to or connection with the obligor or any [[Underwriter]] of any securities of the obligor, or holds, beneficially or otherwise, any interest in the obligor, or any such underwriter, which relationship, connection, or interest involves a material conflict with the interests of such [[Investor]]s;

(4) when the obligor is not obligated to furnish to the trustee under the indenture and to such [[Investor]]s adequate current information as to its financial condition, and as to the performance of its obligations with respect to the securities outstanding under such indenture; or when the communication of such information to such [[Investor]]s is impeded by the fact that information as to the names and addresses of such [[Investor]]s generally is not available to the trustee and to such [[Investor]]s;

(5) when the indenture contains provisions which are misleading or deceptive, or when full and fair disclosure is not made to prospective [[Investor]]s of the effect of important indenture provisions; or

(6) when, by reason of the fact that trust indentures are commonly prepared by the obligor or underwriter in advance of the public offering of the securities to be issued thereunder, such [[Investor]]s are unable to participate in the preparation thereof, and, by reason of their lack of understanding of the situation, such [[Investor]]s would in any event be unable to procure the correction of the defects enumerated in this subsection.

(b) Practices of the character above enumerated have existed
to such an extent that, unless regulated, the public offering of notes, bonds, debentures, evidences of indebtedness, and certificates of interest or participation therein, by the use of means that instruments of transportation and communication in interstate commerce and of the mails, is injurious to the capital markets, to [[Investor]]s, and to the general public; and it is hereby declared to be the policy of this title, in accordance with which policy all the provisions of this title shall be interpreted, to meet the problems and eliminate the practices, enumerated in this section, connected with such public offerings.
