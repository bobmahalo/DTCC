The Depository Trust Company [[DTC]] and National Securities Clearing Corporation [[NSCC]] use the Federal Reserveâ€™s National Settlement Service [[NSS]] to process end-of-day[[EOD]] net funds settlement, by a single file transmission to the Federal Reserve. Each [[Participant]] is required to appoint a settling bank to act on its behalf, although the Participant remains primarily liable for settlement of any net funds obligation due. Settling banks are DTC Participants and member banks of the Federal Reserve System, having accounts at the Federal Reserve to which funds due may be [[Memo Credit]]ed and from which funds owed may be debited. Each settling bank nets credits and debits among the participants on behalf of which it settles, reducing the number and volume of transactions, adding efficiencies to the process.
