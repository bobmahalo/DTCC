GameStop FAQ
9/9/2025


What is a [[Warrants]]?

A warrant is an option to buy common shares issued directly by a company. It gives the

holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a share of common stock at a specified

“exercise price”, on or before the warrant’s “expiration date.

”

What is a warrant dividend?

A warrant dividend is a distribution of warrants by the company [[pro-rata]] to all existing

common shareholders. As with a cash dividend, shareholders do not need to pay any

amount or take any other action to receive the distribution. In the case of a warrant

dividend the value being distributed to all shareholders is in the form of a warrant instead

of cash.

Who will receive the warrants?

GME shareholders will receive one (1) warrant for each ten (10) [[shares]] of common stock

held as of the record date of October 3, 2025, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

As an example, a shareholder who owns 520 or 528 shares of common stock would receive

52 warrants, and a shareholder who owns 2,300 or 2,306 shares of common stock would

receive 230 warrants.

Holders of our Convertible Senior Notes as of the record date will also receive warrants on

an as-converted basis; for each $1,000 of principal amount there will be a distribution of

3.34970 warrants on the 2030 Notes and 3.45872 warrants on the 2032 Notes, in each case

rounded down to the nearest whole warrant. As an example, a holder of $40,000 face

amount of the 2030 Notes would receive 133 warrants.

How many warrants will be issued?

We expect approximately 59 million warrants will be issued, of which approximately 45

million will be distributed to shareholders, and approximately 14 million will be distributed

to convertible noteholders.

When will the warrants be distributed?

On or about October 7, 2025.

When is the expiration date?

October 30, 2026.

What is the exercise price?

$32.00 per share

How much cash will be raised by the company if all warrants are exercised?

If all 59 million warrants are exercised at the exercise price of $32.00, the gross proceeds to

the company would be approximately $1.9 billion.

What do I have to do to receive the warrants?

We believe that in most cases no action is required if you are a shareholder or convertible

noteholder as of the October 3, 2025 record date and you have not lent out your shares or

notes to your [[Broker]] or other parties. Contact your broker or, to the extent your shares are

held in a registered account with GameStop’s [[transfer agent]], contact Client Services at

Computershare Trust Company, N.A., for details.

Can I sell my warrants? Will they trade publicly?

Except for applicable securities laws and company policies that may apply to insiders, we

are not aware of any restrictions on buying or selling the warrants. We intend to apply for

the warrants to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange [[NYSE]] to facilitate such trading, which

may begin under ticker symbol GME WS on the first trading day following the distribution

date. After the Distribution Date, GME shareholders and holders of GME’s convertible notes

can trade or exercise the warrants irrespective of whether they continue to hold or sell their

shares of GME common stock or convertible notes.

Will this dilute my ownership?

There will be no dilution to GME shareholders if no warrants are exercised. By the

expiration date of October 30, 2026, we expect all warrants will have either expired or been

exercised, resulting in the issuance of up to 59 million shares at an issuance price of $32.00.

Since the warrants are being distributed pro-rata to all GME shareholders, if a shareholder

decides to hold and exercise their warrants to purchase additional shares their percentage

ownership of GME common stock (taking into account the convertible notes on an as-

converted basis) is not expected to be diluted. On the other hand, if a current GME

shareholder decides to sell their warrants in the market for cash, they will not be able to

exercise and thus their percentage ownership may decline.

If warrants are exercised, what will GameStop use the proceeds for?

General corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with

GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions.

Will the company be receiving any proceeds immediately?

No. GameStop will not receive any proceeds from this warrant distribution unless some or

all holders exercise their warrants on or before the expiration date of October 30, 2026.

What happens to my warrants if the share price does not go up above the

exercise price?

If you do not sell or exercise your warrants by the expiration date of October 30, 2026, your

warrants will expire worthless. To be clear, you may exercise a warrant at the exercise price

even if the market price of GME shares does not go above the exercise price, but you may

prefer to instead purchase those shares in the market at a lower price.

How will I know if the warrants are about to expire?

We recommend that you remember and set reminders for yourself of the expiration date of

October 30, 2026, to ensure that you do not miss the opportunity to exercise. GameStop will

also issue at least one public press release providing a reminder of the expiration date,

between 10 and 30 days prior to the scheduled expiration date. We also recommend that

you ask your broker what procedures and timeline it will follow regarding exercise,

including because your broker may require you give notice using a particular method and

may apply an earlier deadline than close of business on the expiration date.

When can I exercise my warrants?

You may exercise your warrants at any time from the distribution date until the expiration

date (or until any earlier deadline applied by your broker), subject to certain limited

exceptions included in the warrant agreement.

How do I exercise the warrants?

To exercise the warrants, you must have funds available to pay the exercise price in cash.

You should discuss with your broker its procedures and timeline for effecting exercise on

your behalf, because your broker may require you give notice using a particular method and

may require an earlier deadline than close of business on the expiration date.

I own my GameStop shares in an online brokerage account. How will I receive

my warrants so I can exercise or sell them?

We believe that your broker will be responsible for crediting your account with warrants if

you hold shares or convertible notes as of the record date and such shares or convertible

notes are not being rehypothecated or loaned out. If your shares or convertible notes are

being rehypothecated or loaned out, other mechanics may apply. In all cases you would

need to contact your broker directly for confirmation and any other information regarding

timing and access to warrants, including the mechanics for warrant sales and exercises.

What’s the last day I can buy GameStop shares and still receive the warrants?

We believe that in most cases you must purchase GME shares or convertible notes no later

than close of trading on October 2, 2025 in order to receive the warrant dividend. Purchases

made on or before October 2, 2025 would normally settle in time for you to be a holder at

close of business on October 3, 2025 and thus be eligible to receive warrants.

If you buy shares or convertible notes on October 3, 2025 or later, you will not receive any

warrants. In other words, October 3, 2025 is the expected ex-dividend date—the first

trading day on which GME shares or convertible notes no longer carry the right to receive

the warrants that will be distributed on or around October 7, 2025.

What if I hold a number of GME shares that isn’t a multiple of 10?

The distribution of warrants is at a rate of 0.1 warrants for every share of common stock

(including the distribution to convertible noteholders on an as-converted basis), rounded

down to the nearest whole number of warrants. In practice each broker may round down

the number of warrants deliverable to each account, without aggregating multiple accounts

that you maintain with them. For example, if you hold 16 shares in one account with a

broker and hold 17 shares in another account with the same broker, the broker may deliver

only 1 warrant to each account, for a total distribution of only 2 warrants despite your

ownership of 33 shares across both accounts.

Do non-U.S. shareholders qualify to receive the warrant dividend?

We are not aware of any restrictions on international shareholders or convertible

noteholders receiving warrants if they hold GME common stock or convertible notes as of

the record date. Tax treatment may vary based on a shareholder’s tax domicile as well as

other factors, so both U.S. and non-U.S. shareholders should seek tax advice (see below).

How are the warrants handled for shares held in a retirement brokerage

account?

While we expect that in some cases warrants will be credited to your retirement brokerage

account if you hold shares as of the October 3, 2025 record date, exercising or selling

warrants from within a retirement account may be subject to additional rules or

restrictions, and we recommend that you discuss with your retirement broker, advisor

and/or administrator, as applicable.

For U.S. taxpayers, how will the warrant distribution and/or exercise be treated

for tax purposes?

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of the warrant distribution, and any future exercise of

the warrants, may vary based on an investor’s specific circumstances. GameStop does not

provide tax advice. Regardless of tax domicile, all investors are encouraged to consult their

tax advisor regarding the potential impact of the distribution, and to read the tax reporting

section of the prospectus supplement, which GameStop expects to file with the SEC on the

distribution date.

Can I access a copy of the full warrant agreement?

Yes. GameStop expects to file the full warrant agreement with the SEC on the distribution

date. It will be available via the [[SEC]] [[EDGAR]] system at www.sec.gov and linked on the

GameStop Investor Relations page at investor.gamestop.com.

No Offer or Solicitation

This FAQ is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the

solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in

any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to

registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

The issuance of the warrants has not been registered under the Securities Act, as the

distribution of a warrant for no consideration does not constitute a sale of a security under

Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act. A Form 8-A registration statement and prospectus

supplement describing the terms of the warrants will be filed with the SEC and will be

available on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov. Holders should read the

prospectus supplement carefully, including the Risk Factors section included and

incorporated by reference therein.

6This FAQ contains a general summary of the warrants. Please read the warrant agreement

when it becomes available and filed with the SEC in connection with the distribution date,

as it will contain important information about the terms of the warrants.
