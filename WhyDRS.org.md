WhyDRS maintains free educational resources detailing the United States' financial markets([[Stock Exchange]]s) and infrastructure with a focus on direct registration, a method of [[stock]] ownership available to all investors but rarely used. Owning stock or [[securities]] in your own name - with the [[SEC]] approved Direct Registration System(https://www.sec.gov/about/reports-publications/investor-publications/holding-your-securities-get-the-facts) - provides multiple benefits and safeties not available through common investment vehicles like [[ETF]]s, mutual funds, or [[Custodians]].

[[DRS]] stands for the [[Direct Registration]] System, which is an electronic method to register [[shares]] exclusively in your name. If your shares are not in the DRS, you are not the legal title holder and may not have actual property rights over them. This can affect factors including reliable shareholder democracy, shares being lent without your consent, and ability to access company documents.
