## What is the role of accredited investors?

For many companies raising capital in the private [[Stock Exchange]], the accredited investor definition may define who is in their pool of potential investors, and for investors whether they are eligible to invest. Many of the offering exemptions under [[SEC]] laws limit participation to accredited investors or contain restrictions on participation by non-accredited investors.
