The electronic registration and creation of new [[Securities]].
##### ELECTRONIC SHARES

On the closing date, the [[shares]] or [[Bonds]] are electronically created on [[DTC]]'S books and electronically delivered by [[Book-entry]] to the DTC accounts of [[Participant]]s serving the purchasing [[Investor]]s. DTC records Participants ownership on its books and Participants record investor ownership ([[Beneficial Owner]]) on their books. The securities are registered in DTC's [[Nominee]] name, [[Cede & Co]]. Participants record investor ownership (beneficial owner) on their books.

**1. Requirements for Book-Entry-Only (“[[BEO]]”) Securities**

**a.** **Letters of Representations (“[[LOR]]”)**
BEO securities are DTC-eligible securities for which (i) [[Physical Securities Certificates]] are not available to investors and (ii) DTC, through its nominee, Cede & Co., will hold the entire balance of the offering, either at DTC or through a [[FAST]] Agent in DTC’s Fast Automated Securities Transfer (“FAST”) program. [[Issuer]]s of BEO securities, that are either FAST or where a physical master certificate is delivered to DTC, must submit to DTC a LOR among the Issuer, its Agent (as applicable) and DTC, prior to such issue being determined to be eligible. For corporate and municipal securities, there are two acceptable forms of LOR: a Blanket Issuer Letter of Representations (“BLOR”) or an Issuer Letter of Representations (“ILOR”). A BLOR is Issuer-specific and, except with respect to MMI securities, applicable to all DTC-eligible securities (debt and/or equity) of the same Issuer. Once a BLOR is on file for an Issuer, a new BLOR is not required for future issuances of non-MMI unless the Issuer’s name changes (in which case an opinion of counsel may also be required). An ILOR may be used for discrete issuances, and is applicable only to that issue of securities, such as trust issuances. In all LORs, Issuers represent that they will comply with this [[OA]], as amended from time to time.
