Collateral pledged to Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) can be used to secure discount window advances and extensions of daylight credit for master account activity including charges associated therewith. For more information on the use of collateral under the Payments System Risk ([[PSR]]) policy, refer to the Guide to the Federal Reserve's Payment System Risk Policy on Intraday Credit found on the [Payment System Risk Related Policy Documents](https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/psr_relpolicies.htm) site.

An additional [[haircut]] will generally be applied to all collateral, other than U.S. Treasury and Agency [[Securities]], that is pledged by depository institutions that borrow under the secondary credit program. Additional information about the secondary credit program can be found in the [primary and secondary lending programs webpage](https://www.frbdiscountwindow.org/pages/general-information/primary-and-secondary-lending-programs).
