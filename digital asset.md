If you are considering an Initial Coin Offering, sometimes referred to as an “[[ICO]],” or otherwise engaging in the [[public offering]], sale, or distribution of a digital asset, you need to consider whether the U.S. federal securities laws apply. A threshold issue is whether the digital asset is a “security” under those laws The term “security” includes an “investment contract,” as well as other instruments such as stocks, bonds, and transferable shares. A digital asset should be analyzed to determine whether it has the characteristics of any product that meets the definition of “security” under the federal [[Securities]] laws. In this guidance, we provide a framework for analyzing whether a digital asset has the characteristics of one particular type of security – an “investment contract.” Both the Commission and the federal courts frequently use the “investment contract” analysis to determine whether unique or novel instruments or arrangements, such as digital assets, are securities subject to the federal securities laws.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s [[Howey Case]] and subsequent case law have found that an
“investment contract” exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.5 The so-called “_Howey_ test” applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction, regardless of whether it has any of the characteristics of typical securities. The focus of the _Howey_ analysis is not only on the form and terms of the instrument itself (in this case, the digital asset) but also on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is offered, sold, or resold (which includes [[Secondary market]] sales). Therefore, [[Issuer]]s and other persons and entities engaged in the marketing, offer, sale, resale, or distribution of any digital asset will need to analyze the relevant transactions to determine if the federal securities laws apply.
