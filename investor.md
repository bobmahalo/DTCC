Investor is an individual or entity that allocates capital with the expectation of earning a return. The defining feature of an investor is the assumption of risk, as investing involves the possibility of losing some or all of the capital invested.

Investors allocate capital in a variety of instruments, including equity (company [[shares]], debt [[Securities]](corporate or government bonds, real estate, and [[Derivatives]] (options, futures, and forwards). Direct investment in a business through debt financing or equity purchase occurs in the [[Primary Market]], while the purchase of shares on a public exchange, such as [[NASDQ]], occurs in the [[Secondary market]]. Shareholders are investors who own stock, and creditors are investors who lend capital. These distinctions matter because they confer different legal rights, especially in bankruptcy.

Financial regulation distinguishes between retail investors and institutional investors. Retail investors are individuals or households holding relatively small [[securities]] stakes. Institutional investors are professional entities such as banks, insurance [[Companies]], pension funds, and [[mutual funds]] that hold large portfolios across [[[[Asset]]]] classes. Because retail investors are viewed as more vulnerable, [[securities]] laws provide them greater consumer protections. In contrast, institutional investors are treated as sophisticated actors who can bear more risk. The [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] reflected this distinction by emphasizing disclosure requirements to protect individuals. In [[SEC]] v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc._, 375 U.S. 180 (1963), the Supreme Court affirmed that the [[securities]] laws were designed to replace the principle of caveat emptor with full disclosure and higher ethical standards.
