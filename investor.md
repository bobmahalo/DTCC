Investor is an individual or entity that allocates capital with the expectation of earning a return. The defining feature of an investor is the assumption of [risk](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/risk), as [investing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/invest) involves the possibility of losing some or all of the capital invested.

Investors allocate capital in a variety of [instruments](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/instrument), including equity (company [shares](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/share)), [debt](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/debt)[securities](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities) (corporate or [government](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/treasury_bond) [bonds](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bond)), [real estate](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/real_estate), and [derivatives](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/derivative) ([options](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/option), futures, and forwards). Direct investment in a business through debt financing or equity purchase occurs in the [primary market](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/primary_market), while the purchase of shares on a [public exchange](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/public_market), such as [NASDAQ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/national_association_of_securities_dealers_automated_quotations_%28nasdaq%29), occurs in the [secondary market](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/secondary_market). [Shareholders](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/shareholder) are investors who own stock, and [creditors](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/creditor) are investors who lend capital. These distinctions matter because they confer different legal rights, especially in [bankruptcy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bankruptcy).

Financial regulation distinguishes between [retail investors](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/retail_investors) and [institutional investors](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/institutional_investor). Retail investors are individuals or households holding relatively small securities stakes. Institutional investors are professional entities such as [banks](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/bank), [insurance](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/insurance) companies, [pension](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/pension) funds, and [mutual funds](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mutual_fund) that hold large portfolios across asset classes. Because retail investors are viewed as more vulnerable, [securities laws](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_law_history) provide them greater [consumer protections](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/consumer_protection_laws). In contrast, institutional investors are treated as sophisticated actors who can bear more risk. The [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/securities_exchange_act_of_1934) reflected this distinction by emphasizing disclosure requirements to protect individuals. In [_SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc._, 375 U.S. 180 (1963)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/375/180/), the Supreme Court [affirmed](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/affirm) that the securities laws were designed to replace the principle of [caveat emptor](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/caveat_emptor) with full disclosure and higher ethical standards.
