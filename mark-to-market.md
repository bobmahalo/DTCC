#11740. Marking to the Market

**(a) Demand for Deposit**

The party who is partially unsecured by reason of a change in the market value of the subject of a contract in [[securities]] may demand from the other party a deposit equal to the difference between the contract price and the market price, without being required to make a mutual deposit. Such deposit shall be made either with the member demanding same or with a mutually agreed-on depositary or, on failure to agree on a depositary, with any member of the [[U.S. Federal Reserve System]] with an office in the financial district of the city where the unsecured party maintains its office.

**(b) Assignment of Contract**

Either party to a contract in securities may assign the contract, either at the time the transaction is effected or at the time a request is made for funds to "mark to the market," provided the other party to the contract assents to the assignment.

**(c) Refund of Deposit**

If the market value of the subject of the contract changes so as to permit a total or partial refund of any deposits which have been made in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Rule, such refunds shall be made on demand.

**(d) Delivery of Demand for Deposit or Refund**

All demands for deposits or refunds shall be in writing and shall be delivered at the office of the party upon whom the demand is made during the business hours of member banks of the Federal Reserve System located in the community where such party maintains its office, and such demands shall be complied with immediately.

**(e) Failure to Comply with Demand**

Failure of a party to comply with a demand for a deposit or refund made in accordance with paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) of this Rule shall entitle the party making the demand to close the contract without notice, by making offsetting purchase or sale contracts in the best available market for the account and liability of the party failing to comply with said demand.

**(f) Contract Closure**

No contract shall be closed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Rule prior to the expiration of regular delivery time in the community where the party making the demand maintains its office, on the next business day following the day when notice of such demand was received by the other party.

**(g) Notice of Offsetting Purchase or Sale**

The party making such offsetting purchase or sale contracts shall as promptly as possible on the day on which they are made (1) notify the other party via letter, facsimile transmission, electronic mail, or other comparable written media, and (2) mail or deliver formal confirmation of same to the other party and a copy of said confirmation to the Committee.
