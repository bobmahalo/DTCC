Only Participants can request that [[DTC]] make a security eligible. It is therefore incumbent on an [[Issuer]] to have a relationship with an [[Underwriter]] or other financial institution that is a Participant or is directly associated with a Participant that is willing to sponsor the eligibility process for the Issuerâ€™s [[Securities]]. A Participant may submit an eligibility request through the [[Underwriting]] services of DTC at the time a security is initially being offered and distributed to the marketplace or at a later time for already issued and outstanding securities. (New securities that result from reorganizations of already held and Eligible Securities are also reviewed for continuing eligibility.)
