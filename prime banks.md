“Prime bank” investments are scams.

Promoters of “prime bank” programs often claim that investors’ funds will be used to buy and trade supposed “prime bank” instruments, and that investors will receive guaranteed, high investment returns with little or no risk. Promoters try to make the schemes sound legitimate by using complex, sophisticated, and official-sounding terms. These may include: debenture, standby letter of credit, bank guarantee, prime world bank financial instrument, private funding project, offshore trade or trading program, trading platform, trading facility, trade slot, high-yield trading or roll program, guaranteed bank note, or some variation.
