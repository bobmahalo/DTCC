DTC holds the deposited [[Securities]] in “[[Fungible bulk]],” meaning that there are no specifically identifiable shares directly owned by the [[DTC]] [[Participant]]s. Rather, each DTC participant holds a pro rata interest or position in the aggregate number of shares of a particular [[issuer]] held at DTC. Correspondingly, each customer of a DTC participant – such as an individual [[Investor]] – owns a pro rata interest in the shares in which the DTC participant has a pro rata interest.
