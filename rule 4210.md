**(b) Initial [[Margin]]**

For the purpose of effecting new [[Securities]] transactions and commitments, the customer shall be required to deposit margin in cash and/or [[securities]] in the account which shall be at least the greater of:

(1) the amount specified in [[Reg T]], or Rules 400 through 406 of [[SEC]] Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures, or Rules 41.42 through 41.49 under the Commodity Exchange Act ("[[CEA]]"); or

(2) the amount specified in paragraph (c) of this Rule; or

(3) such greater amount as [[FINRA]] may from time to time require for specific [[securities]]; or

(4) equity of at least $2,000 except that cash need not be deposited in excess of the cost of any security purchased (this equity and cost of purchase provision shall not apply to "when distributed" [[securities]] in a cash account). The minimum equity requirement for a "pattern day trader" is $25,000 pursuant to paragraph (f)(8)(B)(iv)a. of this Rule.

Withdrawals of cash or [[securities]] may be made from any account which has a debit balance, "[[short position]]" position or commitments, provided it is in compliance with Regulation T and Rules 400 through 406 of SEC Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures and Rules 41.42 through 41.49 under the CEA, and after such withdrawal the equity in the account is at least the greater of $2,000 ($25,000 in the case of a "pattern day trader") or an amount sufficient to meet the maintenance margin requirements of this Rule.

**(c) Maintenance Margin**

The margin which must be maintained in all accounts of customers, except as set forth in paragraph (e), (f) or (g) and for cash accounts subject to other provisions of this Rule, shall be as follows:

(1) 25 percent of the current market value of all margin [[securities]], as defined in Section 220.2 of Regulation T, except for security futures contracts, "long" in the account.

(2) $2.50 per share or 100 percent of the current market value, whichever amount is greater, of each stock "short" in the account selling at less than $5.00 per share; plus

(3) $5.00 per share or 30 percent of the current market value, whichever amount is greater, of each stock "short" in the account selling at $5.00 per share or above; plus

(4) 5 percent of the principal amount or 30 percent of the current market value, whichever amount is greater, of each bond "short" in the account.

(5) The minimum maintenance margin levels for security futures contracts, "long" and "short", shall be 20 percent of the current market value of such contract. (See paragraph (f)(10) of this Rule for other provisions pertaining to security futures contracts.)

(6) 100 percent of the current market value for each non-margin eligible equity security held "long" in the account.

**(d) Additional Margin**

Procedures shall be established by members to:

(1) review limits and types of credit extended to all customers;

(2) formulate their own margin requirements; and

(3) review the need for instituting higher margin requirements, [[mark-to-market]]s and collateral deposits than are required by this Rule for individual [[securities]] or customer accounts. [[FINRA]]
