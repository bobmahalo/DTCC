Public Offerings of Securities With Conflicts of Interest

**(a) Requirements for Participation in Certain [[public offering]]s**

No member that has a conflict of interest may participate in a public offering unless the offering complies with subparagraph (1) or (2).

(1) There must be prominent disclosure of the nature of the conflict of interest in the prospectus, offering circular or similar document for the public offering, and one of the following conditions must be met:

(A) the member(s) primarily responsible for managing the public offering does not have a conflict of interest, is not an affiliate of any member that does have a conflict of interest, and meets the requirement of paragraph (f)(12)(E);

(B) the [[securities]] offered have a bona fide public market; or

(C) the securities offered are investment grade rated or are securities in the same series that have equal rights and obligations as investment grade rated securities.

(2) (A) A qualified independent [[Underwriter]] has participated in the preparation of the registration statement and the prospectus, offering circular, or similar document and has exercised the usual standards of "due diligence" in respect thereto; and

(B) there must be prominent disclosure in the prospectus, offering circular or similar document for the offering of:

(i) the nature of the conflict of interest;

(ii) the name of the member acting as qualified independent underwriter; and

(iii) a brief statement regarding the role and responsibilities of the qualified independent underwriter.

**(b) Escrow of Proceeds; Net Capital Computation**

(1) All proceeds from a public offering by a member of its securities shall be placed in a duly established escrow account and shall not be released therefrom or used by the member in any manner until the member has complied with subparagraph (2) hereof.

(2) Any member offering its securities pursuant to this Rule shall immediately notify [[FINRA]] when the public offering has been terminated and settlement effected and shall file with FINRA a computation of its net capital computed pursuant to the provisions of [[SEA Rule 15c3-1]] (the net capital rule) as of the settlement date. If at such time its net capital ratio as so computed is more than 10:1 or, net capital fails to equal 120 percent of the minimum dollar amount required by Rule 15c3-1 or, in the event the member calculates its net capital requirement using the alternative standard (set forth in Rule 15c3-1(a)(1)(ii)), its net capital is less than seven percent of aggregate debit items as computed in accordance with Rule 15c3-3a, all monies received from sales of securities of the public offering must be returned in full to the purchasers thereof and the offering withdrawn, unless the member has obtained from the [[SEC]] a specific exemption from the net capital rule. Proceeds from the sales of securities in the public offering may be taken into consideration in computing net capital ratio for purposes of this paragraph.

(3) Any member offering its securities pursuant to this Rule shall disclose in the registration statement, offering circular or similar document a date by which the offering is reasonably expected to be completed and the terms upon which the proceeds will be released from the escrow account described in paragraph (b)(1).

**(c) Discretionary Accounts**

Notwithstanding [[NASD Rule 2510]], no member that has a conflict of interest may sell to a discretionary account any security with respect to which the conflict exists, unless the member has received specific written approval of the transaction from the account holder and retains documentation of the approval in its records.
