A shelf offering is an offering of [[Securities]] registered by an [[Issuer]] pursuant to [[SEC]] [[Rule 415]], where the [[securities]] are expected to be sold on a delayed or continuous basis, provided that the issuer meets the SEC's eligibility requirements for use of Form S-3, F-3 or any other Form filed with the SEC for that purpose. [[FINRA]]’s Corporate Financing Department recognizes that issuers and members engaged in the distribution of a shelf offering may need to access the market very quickly.

The review process for shelf offerings provides [[FINRA]] members with clearance (24/7) for shelf filings, including those of Well-Known Seasoned Issuers (WKSIs).

In order to obtain clearance for a shelf offering in the [[public offering]] Filing System, you must provide the following information:

- the [[Securities Act of 1933]] registration number;
- the Fed Wire Number and date; and
- if specifically requested by [[FINRA]], other documents and information set forth in [[FINRA]] [[Rule 5110]](a)(4)(A) and (B).

[[FINRA]] will access the base shelf registration statement, amendments and prospectus supplements in the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval ([[EDGAR]]) system and populate the information necessary to conduct a review in [[FINRA]]’s Public Offering System. Upon filing of the required registration statement number pursuant to [[FINRA]] Rule 5110(a)(4)(E)(i), [[FINRA]] will provide a no objections opinion. To further facilitate issuers’ ability to timely access capital markets, [[FINRA]]’s review of documents and information related to a shelf takedown offering for compliance with [[FINRA]] Rule 5110 will occur on a post-takedown basis.
