Many traders try to profit from [[Stock]]s that rise in value. But some do the opposite—their idea is profiting from stocks that _decline_ in value—through a strategy known as short selling.

Short selling involves borrowing a security whose price you think is going to fall and then selling it on the open market. You then buy the same stock back later, hopefully for a lower price than you initially sold it for, return the borrowed stock to your broker, and pocket the difference. 

For example, let's say a stock is trading at $50 a share. You borrow 100 shares and sell them for $5,000. The price subsequently declines to $25 a share, at which point you purchase 100 shares to replace those you borrowed, netting $2,500.

Short selling may sound straightforward, but this kind of speculative trading involves considerable risk. Here's a closer look at how it works—and what to consider before taking the plunge.
