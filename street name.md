just about as close as i have found to the admission of a new [[Asset]] being created while the original is stored in a vault. which makes one wonder if this new [[Asset]] is backed 1 for 1, and if there are any requirements that it is.

Many [[Investor]]s today hold [[Securities]] in street name with a [[Broker]]-dealer. With street name registration, the securities you purchase are registered on the [[Issuer]]’s books in the name of an [[intermediary]] (such as your broker-dealer, a clearing agency, or a [[Nominee]] affiliated with the broker-dealer or clearing agency), but your broker-dealer will maintain records showing you as the real or “beneficial” owner. Many brokerage firms will put your securities into street name unless you give them specific instructions that you want to hold your securities in your own name in registered owner form.
