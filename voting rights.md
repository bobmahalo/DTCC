One of your key rights as a [[Street Name]] registered shareholder is the right to vote your shares in corporate elections. Shareholder voting rights give you the power to elect directors at annual or special meetings and make your views known to company management and directors on significant issues that may affect the value of your shares.

If [[Broker]]-dealers have lent customers [[margin]] [[Securities]], or have not received all the [[shares]] that they have purchased for customers, broker-dealers may not have the right to vote as many shares as their customers own. In these cases, broker-dealers use differing methods to distribute [[vote]]s among their customers. Some send a VIF to all customers holding a securities position in that issue, because many customers do not respond. Others allocate the aggregate number of shares the firm is permitted to vote among their customer base, generally allocating a vote first to cash accounts, then fully-paid customers and next to the margin customers, provided there are any remaining shares, and then send out VIFs. (_See_Â the discussion below regarding reconciliation for more detail allocation methods.)
